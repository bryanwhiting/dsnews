In Part I and Part II, we saw different holdout and bootstrap techniques for estimating the generalization performance of a model.

Fitting a model to our training data is one thing, but how do we know that it generalizes well to unseen data? How do we know that it doesn't simply memorize the data we fed it and fails to make good predictions on future samples, samples that it hasn't seen before?

It is open source and free to use.Linux is powering 30% of all websites globally. It is open source and free to use.These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.According to the State of the Octoverse report by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new users joined in 2019 alone!The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.Do you feel the same way?Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now.      You can learn a lot from the source codeSince the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run.      You will work with the smartest peopleCompared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.A good example is the well-known code editor Visual Studio Code which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer.      Your own code could be used globallySince some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called eslint-plugin-unicorn and svelte. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment.      Open source projects are inclusiveA great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project.      Projects are starting to become sustainableThe main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.With websites like OpenCollective or GitHub Sponsors, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time.      How to contribute to open sourceContributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.Don’t know where to start?Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.The README.md file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time!      Wrapping upIt always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.      Helpful resourcesThe State of the Octoverse What is open source?What Motivates a Developer to Contribute to Open-Source Software?<\\/details>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://dev.to/amrsaeedhosny/open-closed-principle-2deh\\\" style=\\\"     \\\" >Open Closed Principle<\\/a><details><summary>Now it’s the time to start another journey with the second SOLID principle, the Open-Closed.Open-Clo<\\/summary>sed principle states:“Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification”What does that even mean? How could a software entity be opened and closed at the same time!Let’s start explaining by using a real-world scenario to illustrate the problem, then moving into the solution and the technical details.class PhotoViewer{    void openPhoto(){        System.out.println(\\\"Open JPEG photo!\\\");      }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now you wrote your photo viewer class, and you’re quite sure that it has to open JPEG photos only. Later you realized that your users are continuously trying to view PNG photos. And because your app doesn’t support, it raises an error. So, you decided to edit the source code so that it supports PNG.class PhotoViewer{      void openPhoto(String type){        if(type == \\\"JPEG\\\"){                  System.out.println(\\\"Open JPEG photo!\\\");        }            else if(type == \\\"PNG\\\"){            System.out.println(\\\"Open PNG photo!\\\");            }        else{            System.out.println(\\\"Photo type is not supported!\\\");        }    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now, what are the problems of your code after making the changes?What if you decided to add another type? Which is 100% going to happen now or then?At that moment, you would add another else if statement. Adding a new type after another makes open photo function too large as a function. And because all types exist at the same place, removing some lines of code from one type may crash the others.So the code is open for extension, which means you can extend it by other features. But not closed for modification, because every time you add a type you modify the open photo function lines of code. Many changes at the same block of code for different reasons is an indication of bad design.Okay, I know you might have thought about separating JPEG and PNG into different functions at the photo viewer class. I’m with you, let’s try it!class PhotoViewer{      void openJpegPhoto(){            System.out.println(\\\"Open JPEG photo!\\\");    }    void openPngPhoto(){        System.out.println(\\\"Open PNG photo!\\\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now your code is open for extension. You can add new types easily by adding new functions. But the same problem still exists. The solution is not 100% closed for modification, as the class lines of code are going to be affected by the changes. Also notice that adding another type to the photo viewer class is going to make it larger with more responsibilities. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.I know you’re tired, but believe me, it worth it.The solution is about using Object-Oriented Programming features by using a generic interface to represent a generic photo type that any new type can implement.interface Photo{    void open();}class PhotoJpeg implements Photo{      void open(){            System.out.println(\\\"Open JPEG photo!\\\");      }}class PhotoPng implements Photo{    void open(){            System.out.println(\\\"Open PNG photo!\\\");      }}class PhotoViewer(){      void openPhoto(Photo photo){            photo.open();      }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    You can see that adding a new type won’t change a single line of code from the source code. You only need to implement the photo interface with the new type and send the photo to the photo viewer to be opened.class PhotoGif implements Photo{      void open(){            System.out.println(\\\"Open GIF photo!\\\");      }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The solution is 100% open for extension and closed for modification. Notice that the single responsibility principle is also applied.Now you know that Open-Closed means that your code is open to be extended by new functionalities and closed in terms of changing the source code, but appending to it.Wait for a new journey with the third SOLID principle, Liskov Substitution!Photo viewers are used everywhere, literally. You can find them on social media platforms such as facebook or twitter. Also, you can find them on your smartphone as gallery applications. They’re considered a key feature in many apps.If you decided to develop a photo viewer with your own, users would expect it to open photos of any type. It could be a JPEG photo. It might be a PNG. Sometimes it’s not the case that a specific type is supported by your photo viewer. Hence, you need to change the source code of your photo viewer to support that type.How to guarantee that a new type added to your photo viewer won’t affect an already existing one? You may edit your application to support a GIF type, but it crashes the application when you open a PNG photo. How to prevent that from happening? And how to guarantee enough flexibility to add and remove other types in the future without affecting each other.The solution is the Open-Closed principle, as you certainly would guess.Recalling the PhotoViewer class from the Single Responsibility article with a slight change.<\\/details>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://dev.to/sriramvsharma/drawing-a-world-map-in-13-lines-of-code-368a\\\" style=\\\"     \\\" >How To: Draw a World Map with D3 in just 16 lines <\\/a><details><summary>Data-Driven Documents (D3) is an amazing data visualization library. It's pretty mindblowing that yo<\\/summary>u can draw a map of the world, with all the countries in it in just 16 lines of code.import { select, json, geoPath, geoNaturalEarth1 } from 'd3';import { feature } from 'topojson';const svg = select('svg');const projection = geoNaturalEarth1();const pathGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);svg.append('path')    .attr('class', 'sphere')    .attr('d', pathGenerator({type: 'Sphere'}));json('https://unpkg.com/world-atlas@1.1.4/world/110m.json')  .then(data =&gt; {    const countries = feature(data, data.objects.countries);    svg.selectAll('path').data(countries.features)      .enter().append('path')        .attr('class', 'country')        .attr('d', pathGenerator);  });    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Granted, there's an index.html file with another 12 lines of code, and a CSS file with another 10, but still. What's exactly going on here? How do these lines finesse an entire world map?! FYI, this code comes from a free 13-hour video course posted on FreeCodeCamp. Before we jump into the code, read up on this D3 concept called the data join, how to write CSS, and load data. For highest fidelity, watch this 17-minute video and come back to get a line-by-line breakdown here. Line 1:import { select, json, geoPath, geoNaturalEarth1 } from 'd3';    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The D3 library was loaded in the index.html file using a script tag on line 6. We're importing four D3 modules using ES6 module syntax here.select This d3 module selects the first DOM element that matches the specified selector string. json A function from the d3-fetch module that fetches the JSON file at the specified input URL.geoPath This module converts the data path into an SVG path. A string that we can use on SVG paths.geoNaturalEarth1 A geographic map projection style. Line 2:import { feature } from 'topojson';    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    TopoJSON is an extension of GeoJSON (a format designed for representing geographical features using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)) that encodes topology.Topojson.feature is the function that we need to convert our TopoJSON into geoJSON. In our code we can say import {feature} from topojson and in line 15, we  invoke feature, passing in as the first argument the data and the second argument is the countries.Line 3:const svg = select('svg');    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. We're calling the D3 module select on the SVG element which was declared in the index.html file, and assigning it to a named constant called svg.Line 4,5:const projection = geoNaturalEarth1();const pathGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We make use of the geoNaturalEarth1 projection style that we imported in line 1. We assign it to a named constant, which is passed on to the geoPath.projection function on line 5. geoPath is a path generator that generates an SVG path data string here.Line 6-8:svg.append('path')    .attr('class', 'sphere')    .attr('d', pathGenerator({type: 'Sphere'}));    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    These three lines draw a sphere around the World map. We draw a new path by appending the SVG on line 6, and on this path, on line 9, we set the d attribute  to be our pathGenerator, and pass in an object where the type is 'Sphere'. Line 9-15json('https://unpkg.com/world-atlas@1.1.4/world/110m.json')  .then(data =&gt; {    const countries = feature(data, data.objects.countries);    svg.selectAll('path').data(countries.features)      .enter().append('path')        .attr('class', 'country')        .attr('d', pathGenerator);  });    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We fetch the shape data of the countries from the world-atlas TopoJSON file, and then pass a function as input, the data. We invoke topojson.feature, passing in as the first argument the data, and the second argument is the countries(data.object.countries). We then draw a path for each country in countries.features using the selection.enter() update pattern, and set its class as 'country' (for CSS styling purposes). The outline of the country is defined by the d attribute, which defines the path to be drawn.<\\/details>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://dev.to/dailydevtips1/vanilla-javascript-countdown-clock-49h7\\\" style=\\\"     \\\" >Vanilla JavaScript countdown clock<\\/a><details><summary>A time ago, we made this cool year loading bar, and this made me think a countdown timer would also <\\/summary>be cool.Since I'm getting married next year, let's use that as an example.We will be creating an end date, and every second we will check how long away this is.What you'll learn in this article:✅ Working with JavaScript dates✅ Calculating date differences✅ Converting milliseconds to readable formats✅ Styling our clockThe end result will look like this:      HTML StructureLet's start by defining our HTML structure.&lt;div&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;The big day&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nicole &amp; Chris wedding&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p id=\\\"done\\\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=\\\"days\\\"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; Days&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=\\\"hours\\\"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; Hours&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=\\\"minutes\\\"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; Minutes&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;span id=\\\"seconds\\\"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; Seconds&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We will have a title and intro paragraph, as well as a empty done div. This done div will be used if the timer expired.Then we have a list with days, hours, minutes, and seconds.Default on 0 in case the date expired.      Adding some CSS for stylingNow ofcourse we want this too look a bit nicer.body {  display: flex;  align-items: center;  justify-content: center;  min-height: 100vh;  font-family: Roboto, \\\"Helvetica Neue\\\", Arial, sans-serif;  text-align: center;  margin: 0;  padding: 0;  background: #8fbfe0;}h1 {  font-size: 3rem;  margin-top: 0;}ul {  display: flex;  list-style: none;  margin: 0;  padding: 0;  margin-top: 2rem;}ul li {  background: #7c77b9;  border-radius: 10px;  padding: 1rem;  display: flex;  flex-direction: column;  margin: 0 0.5rem;  color: #8fbfe0;  box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);}ul li span {  font-size: 2rem;}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    What you'll see is that we remove the main styling from the ul to use Flexbox to center it, and space the elements.Then we add a box-shadow and some colors to make it pop more.      JavaScript countdown timerNow the JavaScript part.Let's first define our end date:const end = new Date(\\\"May 03, 2021 00:00:00\\\").getTime();    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We define the date as a Date object and use the getTime function to get the milliseconds. We do this because it's easier to count with.Now let's get all our output span elements.const dayEl = document.getElementById('days');const hoursEl = document.getElementById('hours');const minutesEl = document.getElementById('minutes');const secondsEl = document.getElementById('seconds');    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The last set of variables we can define to make it easier for ourselves are the time fragment pieces.const seconds = 1000;const minutes = seconds * 60;const hours = minutes * 60;const days = hours * 24;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    What this means:1000 seconds = 1 millisecond so if we do (time / 1000) we get our seconds(seconds * 60) = 1 minute (60.000 milliseconds)(minutes * 60) = 1 hour, because 1 hour has 60 seconds.(hours * 24) = 1 day, because 1 day has 24 hoursNow we will need to create a setInterval function to run every second.const x = setInterval(function () {    // Code here}, seconds);    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We attach it to a const to be able to unset it if it's no longer needed.Now, let's get the current timestamp and a difference between our end date and now.let now = new Date().getTime();const difference = end - now;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The difference will now have the difference in milliseconds between now and our set date.Let's first check if it's not already expired.if (difference &lt; 0) {    clearInterval(x);    document.getElementById(\\\"done\\\").innerHTML = \\\"We're married! 🎉\\\";    return;}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here, we check if the difference is smaller then 0, then we clear our interval so it won't run again.We also use a return to stop the rest of the function from running.Now all that's left is to show the correct numbers for each element.dayEl.innerText = Math.floor(difference / days);hoursEl.innerText = Math.floor( (difference % days) / hours );minutesEl.innerText = Math.floor( (difference % hours) / minutes );secondsEl.innerText = Math.floor( (difference % minutes) / seconds );      Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    As mentioned in our example we return a floored value of the difference converted to each respectable element.Note the use of the % is to get a remained back.For example, let's say our difference in milliseconds is 15091810828.Days: (15091810828 / 86400000) = 174Hours: (15091810828 % 86400000) = 58210828 =&gt; (58210828 / 3600000) = 16Minutes: (15091810828 % 3600000) = 610828 =&gt; (610828 / 60000) = 10Seconds: (15091810828 % 60000) = 10828 =&gt; (10828 / 1000) = 10This might be a bit much. I'd advise you to even write down one number and calculate it on paper to get a good feel for what's happening.There we go, we now have a countdown timer in JavaScript, let me know what you create with this cool piece of code.

Recently I completed a back-end coding challenge and I decided that it was a great opportunity to look into Postman since I've heard of it being used to simulate HTTP calls.  After looking into it for a few minutes, I realized that the reason I hadn't used it was because, as a full-stack developer, I've always built a front-end to go along with any back-end that I built.  But after running one or two calls, I was hooked.  It was so much faster and more controllable than building a set of forms or browser fields for testing my functionality.  I was also surprised at how simple it was to learn and use, so this post is simply to demonstrate how simple it is by comparing it to the alternative of building a simple front-end stub for the same purpose.      Setting up PostmanTo use Postman, you can either download the app or access via your web browser. If you use the web version, you'll want to download the desktop agent upon signing up, otherwise there are limitations to what you can do.Once you access Postman, you can sign up for a free account, then you'll be all set.

Lazy dev here, and today we are going to discuss computer eyes 👁👁 that help us to test how our<\\/summary> products look like. The visual regression tools that we are using every day are extremely slow. That is the fact. At least because the task to compare 2 images is hard. And I tried to fix this 👀. But first of all, let's take a look at how visual regression tools work under the hood and what they are actually doing.      Image comparisonImage comparison itself is pretty hard. We can not just compare 2 image buffers using \\\"===\\\" and even we can not take all the pixels from the image and compare them one by one. Why? Because human eyes can not see the difference between all the colors. For example, how do you think – do these colors are the same or not? If yes – 👍 you have a really good vision! But 95% of people will not spot the difference between rgba(200, 100, 100, 250) and rgba(200, 100, 95, 250) colors.That's why in order to visually compare images – we need to take all the pixels in the image and it is a lot (for a full-HD screenshot (1920x1080) we have 1920 * 1080 = 2 090 880 pixels) – iterate them one by one and calculate the color difference. This is a hard task for computers. So the algorithm is: 1) Read and decode the image2) Make a loop with millions iterations, make some calculations and save the different pixels3) Make an image of different pixels 4) Encode and save the image diff But the result is extremely helpful when you are testing the user interface:      The slownessBut unfortunately, tools that we are commonly using to compare screenshots are extremely slow. And they are slow not because they had a bad code inside. The main problem is that they are often written in the wrong language* or doing some useless job under the hood.For example, the most popular image comparison tool in the javascript community – pixelmatch is really slow in Node.js environment (but blazing fast in the browser otherwise). Using pixelmatch to comparing 2 screenshots of https://cypress.io home page will take around 7-8 seconds.       Impact on your CIThis really affects our CI time. Let's calculate the CI time for visual regression if we are running 25000 screenshot tests per month. And this number is not something overwhelming. It is a very basic plan of https://percy.io, which is usually not enough for huge projects. So, if we are running 25000 visual tests and each screenshot test running for 7 seconds we are spending 48,6 hours on CI!25000 * 7 / 3600 = 48,611111111    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    That is a lot! This can take even more time than all the other UI tests and that's why performance for this sort of task really matters. Cause if we can save at least 3 seconds per each snapshot we will save 20 hours per month.25000 * 3 / 3600 = 20,83333     Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          SolutionThat was a pain point for me, so I decided to fix this – and wrote that fastest in the world image comparison tool. And I am happy to introduce you odiff! 👀🥳🎉 It was designed to handle the \\\"huge\\\" images, be fast, memory-efficient, and save your CI time.This tool is running the same comparison 2 times faster than analogs!

A simple closure looks like this:function outer(){   let name = \\\"John Doe\\\";   function inner(){      return name;   }   return inner();}  &gt;&gt; outer() // returns \\\"John Doe\\\"    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Closures can be used in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Swift, C#, Objective C and a few of other languages. I'll stick to using simple JavaScript examples as it's similar to most languages and is easy to understand. I'll also give Python examples when the JavaScript approach won't work the same way. outer is a regular function, while inner is a closure since it was defined inside outer and has access to it's variables.       Closures have access to:Their local scope(variables defined inside the inner function)The scope of their outer functionsThe global scopeNow, let's use a more intuitive example to understand how to use closures:function setGreeting(greeting){   function setName(name){      return `${greeting}, ${name}`;   }   return setName;}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Quite self-explanatory function, the outer function takes a greeting as an argument, and the inner function takes a name as an argument and returns the greeting and name together. You might notice that unlike the first example, in this case, the outer function returns the inner function without calling it - without the parentheses. We'll see how this affects the code and how we call the functions.&gt;&gt; let welcome = setGreeting(\\\"Welcome\\\")&gt;&gt; // This sets greeting=\\\"Welcome\\\"&gt;&gt; typeof(welcome) // returns \\\"function\\\"&gt;&gt; welcome // prints f setName(name){...}&gt;&gt; // So welcome is equivalent to setName&gt;&gt; // We can call it with the \\\"name\\\" argument&gt;&gt; welcome(\\\"John\\\") // prints \\\"Welcome, John\\\"&gt;&gt; welcome(\\\"Joan\\\") // prints \\\"Welcome, Joan\\\"    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We can see from this that the first call to setGreeting sets the greeting, and returns the inner function for use. This means we can use welcome just like it were setName. This can be very useful in cases where we need multiple functions that do something similar with different contexts, rather than creating a function for each greeting, we create one function to set the greeting, and an inner function to print the greeting and name. That might sound like a bit much to take in, so let's look at practical use cases.       Creating functions with ContextYou're filling a form for all graduating students in your department. There's a lot of details and most of them seem to be general for everyone, like department, isAdult, certificate, country, race, faculty etc. With only very few unique fields like fullName and stateOfOrigin. You could easily create a Closure where all the general fields are set by the outer function, and the inner function only takes the unique fields:function setGeneral(general){   // general is an object containing all general details   function setUnique(fullName, stateOfOrigin){      // We use the spread operator \\\"...\\\"       // to add fullName and stateOfOrigin to the object      fillForm({...general,          fullName: fullName,          stateOfOrigin: stateOfOrigin         });   }   return setUnique;}&gt;&gt; cs = {department:\\\"Computer Science\\\",&gt;&gt; isAdult: true,&gt;&gt; certificate: \\\"B.Sc. Comp\\\",&gt;&gt; country: \\\"Nigeria\\\",&gt;&gt; race: \\\"Negro\\\",&gt;&gt; faculty: \\\"ICT\\\"};&gt;&gt; csStudent = setGeneral(cs);&gt;&gt; // Now we can use csStudent to easily fill forms&gt;&gt; csStudent(\\\"John Doe\\\", \\\"Lagos\\\")&gt;&gt; csStudent(\\\"Ciroma Chukwuma\\\", \\\"Abuja\\\")    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The syntax for Python is similar, using a dictionary, we'd update it with the fullName and stateOfOrigin keys using general.update({\\\"fullName\\\":fullName, \\\"stateOfOrigin\\\": stateOfOrigin})       Creating private attributesLanguages like Java give you the option to make certain attributes(properties) private. That's not the case for JavaScript or Python. But we can enforce that using closures.function Person(){   let name = \\\"\\\";   let age = 0;   function setName(name){      name = name;   }   function getName(){      return name;   }   function grow(){      age += 1;   }   function getAge(){      return age;   }   accessible = {setName: setName,                 getName: getName,                 grow: grow,                 getAge: getAge};   return accessible;}&gt;&gt; john = Person()&gt;&gt; john.setName(\\\"John\\\")&gt;&gt; john.grow();&gt;&gt; john.grow();&gt;&gt; john.getName() // prints \\\"John\\\"&gt;&gt; john.getAge() // prints 2&gt;&gt; john.name // undefined&gt;&gt; john.age // undefined    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This is a simple Object Oriented application of closures, which can be used to imitate private attributes. The function returns an object(dictionary) of functions to be accessible from outside the Person function, thus making them accessible by dot notation(i.e john.grow()). While keeping the attributes not returned - name and age - inaccessible outside the Person function.Python dictionary keys can't be accessed using dots, so here's a way you can do the same in Pythonfrom types import SimpleNamespacedef Person():   #same code, but in Python   def grow():      nonlocal age      #python needs to know age is not a local      #variable before directly operating on it      age += 1   accessible = {}#same thing as well   return SimpleNamespace(**accessible)# And that's it, SimpleNamespace will make them # accessible using dot notation    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          SummaryWith a better understanding of Closures, we can say closures are functions that keep their namespace(variables and or functions) after execution. Making it possible to setup an initial environment first before usage. Keep in mind that closures involve multiple functions, making your code a bit slower and more memory consuming. Try to avoid using them if you're not getting the benefits peculiar to Closures. Otherwise, enjoy.<\\/details>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://dev.to/darlantc/avoid-using-else-write-a-better-code-12l9\\\" style=\\\"     \\\" >Avoid using ELSE, write a better code<\\/a><details><summary>At the beginning of our career, every developer learns the if else conditionals and immediately star<\\/summary>t using it everywhere.  I would say it is normal because the use case is quite simple to understand, \\\"if the condition is true, then do this, otherwise, do something else\\\".You can even easily identify a code written by a junior developer just reading all the if else used in their code. This is normal and part of the learning process. But as we gain more experience we learn better ways to do the same things.The problem with the else is that it doesn't have the proper context as it's own, and you always must back to if to remember what it does. And, in many cases, it is completely useless, as I will show you.      The not necessary caseConsider the following code:func multiply(ifExists value: Int?, by: Int = 2) -&gt; Int {    if let value = value {        return value * by    } else {        return 0    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    It's a simple Swift function with an optional parameter (the Int? describes it if you are new to Swift).If the parameter is not nil (mainly known as null) multiply it by the second parameter (which is not optional but have a default value 2). But if the parameter is nil then return zero as a result.Wait a minute... is the else statement necessary in this code? It is not. We can easily refactor this to return right after the if statement:func multiply(ifExists value: Int?, by: Int = 2) -&gt; Int {    if let value = value {        return value * by    }    return 0}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Much cleaner, right?In Swift, you can also use guard, if you prefer (I like this one):func multiply(ifExists value: Int?, by: Int = 2) -&gt; Int {    guard let value = value else { return 0 }    return value * by}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          The return earlier caseEvery time you collect user input you will need to validate it before using it. It is very common to see codes like that:func submit(email: String, phone: String) -&gt; Void {    if isValidEmail(email) {        if isValidPhone(phone) {            doSomething(email: email, phone: phone)        } else {            displayPhoneError()        }    } else {        displayEmailError()    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Two properties and two else cases. It works, but we have to follow two indentation levels to read every line and understand what is going on.I think it is better to read if we refactor the function to:func submit(email: String, phone: String) -&gt; Void {    if !isValidEmail(email) {        displayEmailError()        return    }    if !isValidPhone(phone) {        displayPhoneError()        return    }    doSomething(email: email, phone: phone)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now we are using return inside if to stop the execution of the function when the input is invalid. This way we maintain our code with just one indentation level, which is easy to read top to bottom.      ConclusionThe else statement is a tool we have to write code but most of the time it is useless and you should avoid using it. We have other (and better) options.Every time I write else in my code I immediately ask myself: is it really necessary? And then most of the time I just refactor it to remove it.<\\/details>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://databricks.com/blog/2020/11/13/how-to-evaluate-data-pipelines-for-cost-to-performance.html\\\" style=\\\"     \\\" >How to Evaluate Data Pipelines for Cost to Performance<\\/a><details><summary>Learn best practices for designing and evaluating cost-to-performance benchmarks from Germany’s #1 w<\\/summary>eather portal.

It’s something every designer learns early on: Add wh<\\/summary>itespace. Elements need air to breathe.As a consequence, I add CSS margins and paddings every day. It’s a magical feeling to see a button come to life with a little margin  padding.It’s one line of CSS that calms the eye immediately.       Everything’s great, CSS is for babies anywayFor a long time, I didn’t really care too much about the differences between margin and padding. Nevertheless, I noticed these basic rules:      paddingAn element with a background color or border needs whitespace inside      marginAn element  needs air to breathe outside of its bodyI applied margins as external properties, padding for introspective. It made sense for me. But often, I couldn’t find a rule and randomly used one of them.      The point where I got confusedOne of the cases I struggled with was headlines. Headlines and text often need a good amount of spacing between them.  &lt;h1&gt; comes with a default margin, which never seemed to help me in any way.margin-top: 0.67em; margin-bottom: 0.67em; 🤔    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Usually, I would remove this margin (which seemed arbitrarily to me) and applied my own padding-bottom, so it would fit the design perfectly. Satisfied with the outcome, I would go on. Eventually, when CMS content got in, I noticed a slightly larger spacing between headline and text. Dammit, these stupid default margins! All the paragraphs have them as well!margin-top: 1em; margin-bottom: 1em; 🤨    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    What did I do? I wanted to maintain the spacing between two paragraphs, but not the first one. So I removed it with p:first-of-type. Now, the spacing would sit fine at least. Sigh.This approach is against the natural behavior of CSS. There’s a reason these elements have default margins – and not paddings. Don't fight it.      Use margins to your advantage!The key understanding here is to really let sink in what it means that margins can collapse. I read it a lot of times but I never saw the advantage over paddings. But in reality, margins are really powerful and clever! Margins can communicate with each other. They shine when combined. Paddings, on the contrary, are stubborn cats that never change. And sometimes, this is exactly the behavior we want.This is extremely helpful when building a design system or generally using a component-based approach, e.g. React or Vue. Imagine a complete component, having padding top and bottom. Now, a second component gets stacked beneath it, containing padding as well. There will be a big gap between the two, too big.If you use margins instead, only the biggest margin will be applied. This is true for text layouts as well. Instead of using paddings on typography tags, use margins. If the default margin is too small, overwrite it with a bigger margin. The headings’ margin-bottom and the paragraph’s margin-top won’t add up anymore but instead, flow into each other nicely.Because HTML was invented for academic papers, it was useful to provide some tags with default styling. Even without any CSS, texts with semantic HTML is still readable. So don’t get angry with the default browser stylings, we have them for a reason! ♥️<\\/details>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://dev.to/sarmadsaleem/container-orchestration-tools-explained-1c4i\\\" style=\\\"     \\\" >Container orchestration tools explained<\\/a><details><summary>The way we write, ship, and maintain software today has evolved drastically in the last few years. H<\\/summary>ow we consume underlying infrastructure to run our software has matured significantly, in that we have seen a transition from bare metal to virtual machines to containers to micro-VMs.The rise in the adoption of microservices has certainly paved the way for containers to be the primary approach for organizations to package and ship their applications. Amid this evolution, we have seen Docker become almost synonymous with containers and Kubernetes emerging as the gold standard of orchestrating those containers. Some of the primary benefits of this transition include fault isolation, resource utilization, and scaling of workloads, all of which have a direct impact on the business.In this post, we'll get into the what and why of container orchestration. We'll also take a look at some of the leading tools out there and stack them up against each other with the aim to help you choose the right tool for the job.We’ll be covering the following topics:What are containers again? Why do we even need them?What Exactly is Container Orchestration?Popular Container Orchestration ToolsKubernetes - The gold standardDocker SwarmProprietary offerings by public cloud providersWhich one is right for me?      What are containers again? Why do we even need them?Back in the day, we ran applications on bare-metal, which is another way of saying physical, on-premise servers. It was time-intensive, expensive and an error-prone endeavor which was extremely slow to scale. In came virtual machines to solve these pain points - a layer of abstraction on top of physical servers allowing us to run multiple operating systems in complete isolation on the same physical servers, enforcing better security, resource utilization, scalability, and a significant reduction in costs.That’s great! But if we have already addressed the aforementioned pain points with virtual machines, then why are we even talking about containers? Well, containers take it up a notch. You can think of them as mini virtual machines that, instead of packaging a full-fledged operating system, try to leverage the underlying host OS for most operations. Container-based virtualization guarantees higher application density and maximum utilization of server resources. An important distinction between virtual machines and containers is that VM virtualizes underlying hardware whereas the container virtualizes the underlying operating system. Both have their own use cases. Interestingly, many container deployments use VM as their host operating system rather than running directly on bare metal.Whether you are building a monolith or a microservices-based architecture, if resilience and the ability to scale fast are important to you, for most types of workloads, containerization is your best bet when it comes to packaging your application.      What exactly is container orchestration?While containers by themselves are extremely useful, they can become quite challenging to deploy, manage, and scale across multiple hosts in different environments. Container orchestration is another fancy word for streamlining this process. Let's unpack it a bit further.At its core, container orchestration is about managing the lifecycle of containers. Whether you are running a monolith or a bunch of microservices, container orchestration tools can help you streamline the container lifecycle management in both scenarios. However, its real utility really shines through at scale in complex dynamic environments. Tools in this space help teams to control and automate many tasks including:Recovering from encountered failures, ensuring that your apps are self-healing, robust, and resilient.Provision and scheduling of containers by allocating required resources based on predefined configurations.Scaling services by adding or removing containers, typically based on some metrics.Monitoring health of containers and hosts.Exposing services to the outside world.Load balancing traffic between multiple containers seamlessly.Most container orchestration tools follow similar mechanisms from a consumer point of view. They allow you to configure your application through configuration files (typically YAML or JSON) that tell the orchestration tool things like - where to get container images, how to do networking, how to handle storage volumes, and where to push logs. In most cases, software teams prefer to version control these configuration files based on their environment (development, staging, or production) to make things auditable and reproducible.These configuration files are handed off to the tool using an interface (typically a CLI). The tool then schedules the deployment and selects the best host to place the containers, based on the constraints defined in the configuration. Once containers are up and running, the tool continuously monitors the app by matching the desired state with the actual state, in addition to querying health checks. If anything doesn't add up and/or results in a failure, it tries to recover from that failure automatically. Being able to run these orchestration tools in disparate environments ranging from a desktop to bare metal servers to cloud-based VMs is a big selling point.      Popular container orchestration toolsWhen Docker emerged in 2013, containers exploded in popularity. A number of tools have since been developed to make container management easier. While they have been around for years, many consider 2017 to be the year that container tools came of age. As of today, there are several open-source and proprietary solutions to manage containers out there. In the open-source space, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Apache Marathon on Mesos, and Hashicorp Nomad are some of the notable players. While the proprietary space is dominated by leading cloud providers, some of the notable examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Container Service, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine &amp; Cloud Run, Microsoft Azure Container Instances &amp; Web Apps for Containers.Let's zoom into some of the most popular ones, stack them up against each other and try to better understand how they differ from each other.      Kubernetes - The gold standardSimilar to how Docker became the de-facto for containerization, the industry has found Kubernetes to rule the container orchestration landscape. That's why most major cloud providers have started to offer managed Kubernetes services as well.It's open-source software that has become the gold standard for orchestrating containerized workloads in private, public, and hybrid cloud environments. Initially developed by engineers at Google, who distilled years of experience in running production workloads at scale into Kubernetes. It was open-sourced in 2014 and has since been maintained by CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation). It's often abbreviated as k8s which is a numeronym (starting with the letter \\\"k\\\" and ending with \\\"s\\\" with 8 other characters in between).Managing containers at scale is usually quite challenging. Why is that? Because running a single Docker container on your laptop may seem trivial but doing that for a large number of containers across multiple hosts in an automated fashion ensuring zero downtime isn't as trivial.Let's take an example of a Netflix-like video-on-demand platform consisting of 100+ microservices resulting in 5000+ containers running atop 100+ VMs of varying sizes. Different teams are responsible for different microservices. They follow a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) driven workflow and push to production multiple times a day. The expectation from production workloads is to be always available, scale up and down automatically if demand changes, and recover from encountered failures.In situations like these, the utility of container orchestration tools really shines. Tools like Kubernetes allow you to abstract away the underlying cluster of virtual or physical machines into one unified blob of resources. Typically they expose an API, using which you can specify how many containers you'd like to deploy for a given app and how they should behave under increased load. The API-first nature of these tools allows you to automate the deployment processes inside your CI pipeline, giving teams the ability to iterate quickly. Being able to manage this kind of complexity in a streamlined manner is one of the major reasons why tools like Kubernetes have gained such popularity.      Underlying architecture &amp; objectsTo understand Kubernetes' view of the world, we need to familiarize ourselves with cluster architecture first. Kubernetes cluster is a group of physical or virtual machines which is divided into two high-level components - the control plane and worker nodes.Control plane - It acts as the brain for the entire cluster, responsible for accepting user instructions, health checking all servers, deciding how to best schedule workloads, and orchestrating communication between components. Constituents include components like kube-apiserver, etcd, kube-scheduler, kube-controller-manager, and cloud-controller-manager.Worker nodes - These are machines responsible for accepting instructions from the control plane and running containerized workloads. Each machine runs a kubelet, kube-proxy, and container runtime.Now that we have some know-how of the Kubernetes architecture, the next milestone in our journey is understanding the Kubernetes object model. Kubernetes has a few abstractions that make up the building blocks of any containerized workload.We'll go over a few different types of objects available in Kubernetes that you are more likely to interact with:Pod - It is the smallest deployable unit of computing in the Kubernetes hierarchy. It can contain one or more tightly coupled containers sharing environment, volumes, and IP space. Generally, it is discouraged for users to manage pods directly. Instead, Kubernetes offers higher-level objects (deployment, statefulset &amp; daemonset) to encapsulate that management.Deployment - High-level object designed to ease the life cycle management of replicated pods. Users describe a desired state in the deployment object and the deployment controller changes the actual state to match the desired state. Generally, this is the object users interact with the most. It is best suited for stateless applications.Stateful Set - You can think of it as a specialized deployment best suited for stateful applications like a relational database. They offer ordering and uniqueness guarantees.Daemon Set - You can think of it as a specialized deployment when you want your pods to be on every node (or a subset of it). It is best suited for cluster support services like log aggregation, security, etc.Secret &amp; Config Map - These objects allow users to store sensitive information and configuration respectively. They can then be exposed to certain apps thus allowing for more streamlined configuration and secrets management.Service - This object groups a set of pods together and makes them accessible through DNS within the cluster. Different types of services include NodePort, ClusterIP, and LoadBalancer.Ingress - The Ingress object allows for external access to the service in a cluster using an IP address or some URL. Additionally, it can provide SSL termination and load balancing as wellNamespace - This object is used to logically group resources inside a clusterNote: There are other objects like Replication Controller, Replica Set, Job, Cron Job, etc. that we have deliberately skipped for simplicity's sake.You can find our dedicated blog post on Kubernetes that gets into examples, features, ecosystem, and commonly asked questions here.      Docker Swarm - Lightweight alternativeLet's differentiate between Docker and Docker Swarm first. Docker is a container runtime comparable with rkt. Docker Swarm, on the other hand, is a cluster management and orchestration tool embedded in the Docker Engine, comparable with Kubernetes and likes. As compared to Kubernetes, it's a slightly less extensible and complex tool that is best suited for people who want an easier path to deploying containers. On a higher level, you'll notice a lot of similarities when it comes to the architecture of both the tools.An important thing to note here is that after Mirantis acquired Docker Enterprise, in late 2019, they announced that the primary orchestrator going forward would be Kubernetes. They'll support Swarm for at least two years and will work on making the transition easier to Kubernetes. Does this mean Docker Swarm is dead and we shouldn't even talk about it? Not really! As of now, all this means is we won't be seeing many Docker Swarm-as-a-service options out there. However, for simpler use cases, it still is a viable option owing to its lightweight and simple nature.      Underlying architectureTo understand Docker Swarm's view of the world, we need to familiarize ourselves with the cluster architecture first. Swarm by itself is a group of physical or virtual machines that are divided into two high-level components, manager node, and worker nodes.Manager node - Similar to Kubernetes Control Plane, it is responsible for receiving service definition from the user and dispatching instructions to worker nodes on how to run that service. Additionally, it also performs the orchestration and management functions necessary to sync the actual state with the desired state of the cluster. Manager nodes elect a single leader to conduct orchestration tasks.Worker node - Similar to Kubernetes worker nodes, it receives and executes tasks dispatched from manager nodes. An agent runs on each worker node and reports back to the manager node on the assigned tasks so that manager can maintain the desired state of each worker.Now that we have some idea of its architecture, let's get into object-level constructs of Docker Swarm.Task - A task carries a Docker container and the commands to run inside the container, it is the atomic unit of scheduling within a swarm. When we declare the desired state of a service, the orchestrator realizes the desired state by scheduling tasks. If the task fails, the orchestrator removes the task and its container and then creates a new task to replace it according to the desired state specified by the service.Service - Service is the definition of tasks to be executed on the nodes. When creating a service, the user specifies which image to the user and which commands to execute inside running containers. There are two types of services - replicated and global. Similar to Kubernetes deployments, in the replicated services model, the manager spins up a specified number of replica tasks among nodes. Similar to Kubernetes daemon set, for global services, swarm runs one task for the service on every available node.Load balancer - Swarm manager uses ingress load balancing to expose services to the outside world. External components like cloud load balancers can access a given service on its port while swarm uses internal load balancing to distribute requests among services within the cluster.      Proprietary offerings by public cloud providers - Let us handle the management overheadJust like in the open-source space, cloud orchestration tools have a pretty competitive propriety space mostly dominated by public cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.These cloud providers also offer a managed version of Kubernetes. What that means is that the provider is responsible for managing and maintaining the control plane of the cluster. This reduces maintenance and management overhead. For the purposes of this section, we'll ignore this and focus on proprietary offerings only.AWS Elastic Container Service - AWS ECS is a fully managed container orchestration service from AWS which has deep integrations with other AWS services like Route53, Secret Manager, IAM, CloudWatch, etc. It offers two ways to run workloads - one is on EC2 virtual machines and the second, more recent one is Fargate which brings serverless capabilities to ECS. Even though it's AWS's home-grown take on how to manage containers at scale, it has a lot of similarities with Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. This can be seen in how users need to define the configuration of their applications as task definitions and then provide these definitions as JSON documents to AWS Console or CLI interface. Depending on the configuration, and which mode you selected (EC2 or Fargate), ECS schedules the tasks composing services appropriately onto the cluster and monitors them constantly to maintain the desired state.GCP Cloud Run - Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless container orchestration platform. It abstracts away all infrastructure management by adopting the serverless model for containers. What that means is that your application can scale down to zero and you don't pay anything when there's no traffic and on the other hand it can scale up to millions of requests almost instantaneously. This in essence is very close to AWS Fargate’s offering. As a consumer of Cloud Run, all you need to do is provide the platform for your Docker containers and it'll take care of the rest. This is quite convenient as all the complexity has been automated or abstracted away. Under the hood, it runs Knative, which is a Kubernetes-based platform to deploy and manage modern serverless workloads. This goes to show the real superpower of Kubernetes - its extensibility, in a way that when leveraged fully, can act as a building block of more developer-friendly platforms.Azure Container Instance - Container Instances is Microsoft Azure's answer to running containers on-demand in a serverless fashion. It is comparable to AWS Fargate and GCP Cloud Run. Since this serverless model allows you to not worry about the underlying infrastructure and just focus on application logic, a lot of management overhead is cut down. From a consumer's perspective, all you need is a Docker container and specify the necessary configuration and the platform handles the rest for you, including things like - provision resources, scaling containers up and down, necessary networking, and health monitoring, to name a few.      Which one is right for me?There's no one size fits all when it comes to container orchestration tools. Choosing the right tool for the job is very use-case dependent. Pay per use, minimum management overhead - If you want to run your containerized apps with straightforward needs and don't want to deal with any management overhead, perhaps your best bet is to use one of the serverless containers offerings out there like AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run or Azure Container Instances. Fine-grain control, flexibility with little management - If your needs require fine-grain control, customization, and flexibility, perhaps a managed version of Kubernetes in form of AWS EKS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS are better suited for your use-case as they reduce the overhead of provisioning and running a Kubernetes cluster while ensuring smooth inter-cloud integrations. Fine-grain control, flexibility within given constraints - If your use case has strict data residency and sovereignty constraints and you are required to run containerized workloads in an on-premises or private cloud setting, perhaps self-managed Kubernetes is the forerunner among all container orchestration tools.<\\/details>\",\"<a href=\\\"https://databricks.com/blog/2020/11/12/data-teams-unite-countdown-to-data-ai-summit-europe.html\\\" style=\\\"     \\\" >Data Teams Unite!

It is open source and free to use.Linux is powering 30% of all websites globally. It is open source and free to use.These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.According to the State of the Octoverse report by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new users joined in 2019 alone!The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.Do you feel the same way?Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now. You can learn a lot from the source codeSince the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run. You will work with the smartest peopleCompared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.A good example is the well-known code editor Visual Studio Code which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer. Your own code could be used globallySince some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called eslint-plugin-unicorn and svelte. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment. Open source projects are inclusiveA great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project. Projects are starting to become sustainableThe main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.With websites like OpenCollective or GitHub Sponsors, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time. How to contribute to open sourceContributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.Don’t know where to start?Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.The README.md file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time! Wrapping upIt always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.

How could a software entity be opened and closed at the same time!Let’s start explaining by using a real-world scenario to illustrate the problem, then moving into the solution and the technical details.class PhotoViewer{ void openPhoto(){ System.out.println(“Open JPEG photo!”); }} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Now you wrote your photo viewer class, and you’re quite sure that it has to open JPEG photos only. Later you realized that your users are continuously trying to view PNG photos. And because your app doesn’t support, it raises an error. So, you decided to edit the source code so that it supports PNG.class PhotoViewer{ void openPhoto(String type){ if(type == “JPEG”){ System.out.println(“Open JPEG photo!”); } else if(type == “PNG”){ System.out.println(“Open PNG photo!”); } else{ System.out.println(“Photo type is not supported!”); } }} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Now, what are the problems of your code after making the changes?What if you decided to add another type? Which is 100% going to happen now or then?At that moment, you would add another else if statement. Adding a new type after another makes open photo function too large as a function. And because all types exist at the same place, removing some lines of code from one type may crash the others.So the code is open for extension, which means you can extend it by other features. But not closed for modification, because every time you add a type you modify the open photo function lines of code. Many changes at the same block of code for different reasons is an indication of bad design.Okay, I know you might have thought about separating JPEG and PNG into different functions at the photo viewer class. I’m with you, let’s try it!class PhotoViewer{ void openJpegPhoto(){ System.out.println(“Open JPEG photo!”); } void openPngPhoto(){ System.out.println(“Open PNG photo!”); }} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Now your code is open for extension. You can add new types easily by adding new functions. But the same problem still exists. The solution is not 100% closed for modification, as the class lines of code are going to be affected by the changes. Also notice that adding another type to the photo viewer class is going to make it larger with more responsibilities. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.I know you’re tired, but believe me, it worth it.The solution is about using Object-Oriented Programming features by using a generic interface to represent a generic photo type that any new type can implement.interface Photo{ void open();}class PhotoJpeg implements Photo{ void open(){ System.out.println(“Open JPEG photo!”); }}class PhotoPng implements Photo{ void open(){ System.out.println(“Open PNG photo!”); }}class PhotoViewer(){ void openPhoto(Photo photo){ photo.open(); }} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode You can see that adding a new type won’t change a single line of code from the source code. You only need to implement the photo interface with the new type and send the photo to the photo viewer to be opened.class PhotoGif implements Photo{ void open(){ System.out.println(“Open GIF photo!”); }} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode The solution is 100% open for extension and closed for modification. Notice that the single responsibility principle is also applied.Now you know that Open-Closed means that your code is open to be extended by new functionalities and closed in terms of changing the source code, but appending to it.Wait for a new journey with the third SOLID principle, Liskov Substitution!Photo viewers are used everywhere, literally. You can find them on social media platforms such as facebook or twitter. Also, you can find them on your smartphone as gallery applications. They’re considered a key feature in many apps.If you decided to develop a photo viewer with your own, users would expect it to open photos of any type. It could be a JPEG photo. It might be a PNG. Sometimes it’s not the case that a specific type is supported by your photo viewer. Hence, you need to change the source code of your photo viewer to support that type.How to guarantee that a new type added to your photo viewer won’t affect an already existing one? You may edit your application to support a GIF type, but it crashes the application when you open a PNG photo. How to prevent that from happening? And how to guarantee enough flexibility to add and remove other types in the future without affecting each other.The solution is the Open-Closed principle, as you certainly would guess.Recalling the PhotoViewer class from the Single Responsibility article with a slight change.\n\n\nDEV Community\n\n\n\n2020-11-14 07:46:54\n\nSat Nov 14, 2020 (0 days ago)\n\n\nHow To: Draw a World Map with D3 in just 16 lines \nData-Driven Documents (D3) is an amazing data visualization library. It’s pretty mindblowing that you can draw a map of the world, with all the countries in it in just 16 lines of code.import { select, json, geoPath, geoNaturalEarth1 } from ‘d3’;import { feature } from ‘topojson’;const svg = select(‘svg’);const projection = geoNaturalEarth1();const pathGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection);svg.append(‘path’) .attr(‘class’, ‘sphere’) .attr(‘d’, pathGenerator({type: ‘Sphere’}));json(‘https://unpkg.com/world-atlas@1.1.4/world/110m.json’) .then(data => { const countries = feature(data, data.objects.countries); svg.selectAll(‘path’).data(countries.features) .enter().append(‘path’) .attr(‘class’, ‘country’) .attr(‘d’, pathGenerator); }); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Granted, there’s an index.html file with another 12 lines of code, and a CSS file with another 10, but still. What’s exactly going on here? How do these lines finesse an entire world map?! FYI, this code comes from a free 13-hour video course posted on FreeCodeCamp. Before we jump into the code, read up on this D3 concept called the data join, how to write CSS, and load data. For highest fidelity, watch this 17-minute video and come back to get a line-by-line breakdown here. Line 1:import { select, json, geoPath, geoNaturalEarth1 } from ‘d3’; Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode The D3 library was loaded in the index.html file using a script tag on line 6. We’re importing four D3 modules using ES6 module syntax here.select This d3 module selects the first DOM element that matches the specified selector string. json A function from the d3-fetch module that fetches the JSON file at the specified input URL.geoPath This module converts the data path into an SVG path. A string that we can use on SVG paths.geoNaturalEarth1 A geographic map projection style. Line 2:import { feature } from ‘topojson’; Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode TopoJSON is an extension of GeoJSON (a format designed for representing geographical features using JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)) that encodes topology.Topojson.feature is the function that we need to convert our TopoJSON into geoJSON. In our code we can say import {feature} from topojson and in line 15, we invoke feature, passing in as the first argument the data and the second argument is the countries.Line 3:const svg = select(‘svg’); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. We’re calling the D3 module select on the SVG element which was declared in the index.html file, and assigning it to a named constant called svg.Line 4,5:const projection = geoNaturalEarth1();const pathGenerator = geoPath().projection(projection); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode We make use of the geoNaturalEarth1 projection style that we imported in line 1. We assign it to a named constant, which is passed on to the geoPath.projection function on line 5. geoPath is a path generator that generates an SVG path data string here.Line 6-8:svg.append(‘path’) .attr(‘class’, ‘sphere’) .attr(‘d’, pathGenerator({type: ‘Sphere’})); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode These three lines draw a sphere around the World map. We draw a new path by appending the SVG on line 6, and on this path, on line 9, we set the d attribute to be our pathGenerator, and pass in an object where the type is ‘Sphere’. Line 9-15json(‘https://unpkg.com/world-atlas@1.1.4/world/110m.json’) .then(data => { const countries = feature(data, data.objects.countries); svg.selectAll(‘path’).data(countries.features) .enter().append(‘path’) .attr(‘class’, ‘country’) .attr(‘d’, pathGenerator); }); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode We fetch the shape data of the countries from the world-atlas TopoJSON file, and then pass a function as input, the data. We invoke topojson.feature, passing in as the first argument the data, and the second argument is the countries(data.object.countries). We then draw a path for each country in countries.features using the selection.enter() update pattern, and set its class as ‘country’ (for CSS styling purposes). The outline of the country is defined by the d attribute, which defines the path to be drawn.\n\n\nDEV Community\n\n\n\n2020-11-14 04:56:05\n\nSat Nov 14, 2020 (0 days ago)\n\n\nVanilla JavaScript countdown clock\nA time ago, we made this cool year loading bar, and this made me think a countdown timer would also be cool.Since I’m getting married next year, let’s use that as an example.We will be creating an end date, and every second we will check how long away this is.What you’ll learn in this article:✅ Working with JavaScript dates✅ Calculating date differences✅ Converting milliseconds to readable formats✅ Styling our clockThe end result will look like this: HTML StructureLet’s start by defining our HTML structure.<div> <h1>The big day<\/h1> <p>Nicole & Chris wedding<\/p> <p id=“done”><\/p> <ul> <li><span id=“days”>0<\/span> Days<\/li> <li><span id=“hours”>0<\/span> Hours<\/li> <li><span id=“minutes”>0<\/span> Minutes<\/li> <li><span id=“seconds”>0<\/span> Seconds<\/li> <\/ul><\/div> Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode We will have a title and intro paragraph, as well as a empty done div. This done div will be used if the timer expired.Then we have a list with days, hours, minutes, and seconds.Default on 0 in case the date expired. Adding some CSS for stylingNow ofcourse we want this too look a bit nicer.body { display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center; min-height: 100vh; font-family: Roboto, “Helvetica Neue”, Arial, sans-serif; text-align: center; margin: 0; padding: 0; background: #8fbfe0;}h1 { font-size: 3rem; margin-top: 0;}ul { display: flex; list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; margin-top: 2rem;}ul li { background: #7c77b9; border-radius: 10px; padding: 1rem; display: flex; flex-direction: column; margin: 0 0.5rem; color: #8fbfe0; box-shadow: 0px 0px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);}ul li span { font-size: 2rem;} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode What you’ll see is that we remove the main styling from the ul to use Flexbox to center it, and space the elements.Then we add a box-shadow and some colors to make it pop more. JavaScript countdown timerNow the JavaScript part.Let’s first define our end date:const end = new Date(“May 03, 2021 00:00:00”).getTime(); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode We define the date as a Date object and use the getTime function to get the milliseconds. We do this because it’s easier to count with.Now let’s get all our output span elements.const dayEl = document.getElementById(‘days’);const hoursEl = document.getElementById(‘hours’);const minutesEl = document.getElementById(‘minutes’);const secondsEl = document.getElementById(‘seconds’); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode The last set of variables we can define to make it easier for ourselves are the time fragment pieces.const seconds = 1000;const minutes = seconds * 60;const hours = minutes * 60;const days = hours * 24; Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode What this means:1000 seconds = 1 millisecond so if we do (time / 1000) we get our seconds(seconds * 60) = 1 minute (60.000 milliseconds)(minutes * 60) = 1 hour, because 1 hour has 60 seconds.(hours * 24) = 1 day, because 1 day has 24 hoursNow we will need to create a setInterval function to run every second.const x = setInterval(function () { // Code here}, seconds); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode We attach it to a const to be able to unset it if it’s no longer needed.Now, let’s get the current timestamp and a difference between our end date and now.let now = new Date().getTime();const difference = end - now; Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode The difference will now have the difference in milliseconds between now and our set date.Let’s first check if it’s not already expired.if (difference < 0) { clearInterval(x); document.getElementById(“done”).innerHTML = “We’re married! 🎉”; return;} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Here, we check if the difference is smaller then 0, then we clear our interval so it won’t run again.We also use a return to stop the rest of the function from running.Now all that’s left is to show the correct numbers for each element.dayEl.innerText = Math.floor(difference / days);hoursEl.innerText = Math.floor( (difference % days) / hours );minutesEl.innerText = Math.floor( (difference % hours) / minutes );secondsEl.innerText = Math.floor( (difference % minutes) / seconds ); Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode As mentioned in our example we return a floored value of the difference converted to each respectable element.Note the use of the % is to get a remained back.For example, let’s say our difference in milliseconds is 15091810828.Days: (15091810828 / 86400000) = 174Hours: (15091810828 % 86400000) = 58210828 => (58210828 / 3600000) = 16Minutes: (15091810828 % 3600000) = 610828 => (610828 / 60000) = 10Seconds: (15091810828 % 60000) = 10828 => (10828 / 1000) = 10This might be a bit much. I’d advise you to even write down one number and calculate it on paper to get a good feel for what’s happening.There we go, we now have a countdown timer in JavaScript, let me know what you create with this cool piece of code.

Recently I completed a back-end coding challenge and I decided that it was a great opportunity to look into Postman since I’ve heard of it being used to simulate HTTP calls. After looking into it for a few minutes, I realized that the reason I hadn’t used it was because, as a full-stack developer, I’ve always built a front-end to go along with any back-end that I built. But after running one or two calls, I was hooked. It was so much faster and more controllable than building a set of forms or browser fields for testing my functionality. I was also surprised at how simple it was to learn and use, so this post is simply to demonstrate how simple it is by comparing it to the alternative of building a simple front-end stub for the same purpose. Setting up PostmanTo use Postman, you can either download the app or access via your web browser. If you use the web version, you’ll want to download the desktop agent upon signing up, otherwise there are limitations to what you can do.Once you access Postman, you can sign up for a free account, then you’ll be all set. It will look like this at first, you’ll click on the ‘+’ tab to get started with your first request: Simple HTTP GetThis endpoint is used to get information. For this demonstration, we’ll be calling on the animals index endpoint. The idea is simply to see the raw response to make sure the backend is working. Mock Front-EndCreate a Get Animals button and the corresponding getAnimals() function:// HTML<button id=“getAnimals” onclick=“getAnimals()”>Get Animals<\/button> Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode // JavaScript:function getAnimals() { const url = // set to whatever your base-url is (‘http://localhost:3000/’ for example) const fetchOptions = { headers: { “Content-Type”: “application/json”, “Accept”: “application/json”, “Authorization”: Bearer ${TOKEN} }, mode: ‘cors’, credentials: ‘include’, method: ‘GET’ } fetch(url + ‘/animals’, fetchOptions) .then(resp => resp.json()) .then(animals => console.log(animals)) // this logs the response to the console as JSON} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Response:Now when you click the ‘Get Animals’ button, the Response will be logged to the console: PostmanTo do the same thing in Postman, first configure the request body and add Authorization if applicable:Body:Authorization:Then click Send and view the Response at the bottom of the screen: Simple HTTP PostThis endpoint is used to create a new Animal. We’ll be calling on the animals create endpoint and will pass in the new animal parameters. We want to see the details of the new animal passed back to us. Mock Front-EndCreate a newAnimal() function and a form to call it:// HTML<h4>New Animal:<\/h4><label for=“name”>Name: <\/label><input id=“name” type=text name=“name”><label for=“says”>Says: <\/label><input id=“says” type=text name=“says”><button class=“submit” onclick=“newAnimal()”>Submit Animal<\/button> Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode // JavaScriptconst name = document.getElementByID(“name”);const says = document.getElementByID(“says”);function newAnimal(name, says) { const fetchOptions = { headers: { “Content-Type”: “application/json”, “Accept”: “application/json”, “Authorization”: Bearer ${TOKEN} }, mode: ‘cors’, credentials: ‘include’, method: ‘POST’, body: JSON.stringify({name: name, says: says}) } fetch(url + ‘/animals’, fetchOptions) .then(resp => resp.json()) .then(animal => console.log(animal))} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Response:Now fill in the form fields with the new animal’s attributes and click the ‘Submit Animal’ button. The new animal’s details will be logged to the console: PostmanConfigure Postman Body and add Authorization if applicable:Body:Authorization:Then click Send and view the Response at the bottom: LessonPostman saved me a TON of time testing and tweaking different HTTP requests. It can also conveniently save your requests allowing you to share them for others to use. This is definitely worth adding to your tool bag.\n\n\nDEV Community\n\n\n\n2020-11-13 21:11:52\n\nFri Nov 13, 2020 (1 days ago)\n\n\nWhy our visual regression is so slow? \nHola! Lazy dev here, and today we are going to discuss computer eyes 👁👁 that help us to test how our products look like. The visual regression tools that we are using every day are extremely slow. That is the fact. At least because the task to compare 2 images is hard. And I tried to fix this 👀. But first of all, let’s take a look at how visual regression tools work under the hood and what they are actually doing. Image comparisonImage comparison itself is pretty hard. We can not just compare 2 image buffers using “===” and even we can not take all the pixels from the image and compare them one by one. Why? Because human eyes can not see the difference between all the colors. For example, how do you think – do these colors are the same or not? If yes – 👍 you have a really good vision! But 95% of people will not spot the difference between rgba(200, 100, 100, 250) and rgba(200, 100, 95, 250) colors.That’s why in order to visually compare images – we need to take all the pixels in the image and it is a lot (for a full-HD screenshot (1920x1080) we have 1920 * 1080 = 2 090 880 pixels) – iterate them one by one and calculate the color difference. This is a hard task for computers. So the algorithm is: 1) Read and decode the image2) Make a loop with millions iterations, make some calculations and save the different pixels3) Make an image of different pixels 4) Encode and save the image diff But the result is extremely helpful when you are testing the user interface: The slownessBut unfortunately, tools that we are commonly using to compare screenshots are extremely slow. And they are slow not because they had a bad code inside. The main problem is that they are often written in the wrong language* or doing some useless job under the hood.For example, the most popular image comparison tool in the javascript community – pixelmatch is really slow in Node.js environment (but blazing fast in the browser otherwise). Using pixelmatch to comparing 2 screenshots of https://cypress.io home page will take around 7-8 seconds. Impact on your CIThis really affects our CI time. Let’s calculate the CI time for visual regression if we are running 25000 screenshot tests per month. And this number is not something overwhelming. It is a very basic plan of https://percy.io, which is usually not enough for huge projects. So, if we are running 25000 visual tests and each screenshot test running for 7 seconds we are spending 48,6 hours on CI!25000 * 7 / 3600 = 48,611111111 Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode That is a lot! This can take even more time than all the other UI tests and that’s why performance for this sort of task really matters. Cause if we can save at least 3 seconds per each snapshot we will save 20 hours per month.25000 * 3 / 3600 = 20,83333 Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode SolutionThat was a pain point for me, so I decided to fix this – and wrote that fastest in the world image comparison tool. And I am happy to introduce you odiff! 👀🥳🎉 It was designed to handle the “huge” images, be fast, memory-efficient, and save your CI time.This tool is running the same comparison 2 times faster than analogs! Yes, it can save you those 3 seconds per snapshot :) Here are some benchmarks: Also, here are the results of comparing the same cypress.io home page screenshot: CommandMean [s]Min [s]Max [s]Relativepixelmatch www.cypress.io-1.png www.cypress.io.png www.cypress-diff.png7.712 ± 0.0697.6647.8961.82 ± 0.03ImageMagick compare www.cypress.io-1.png www.cypress.io.png -compose src diff-magick.png8.881 ± 0.1218.6929.0662.09 ± 0.04odiff www.cypress.io-1.png www.cypress.io.png www.cypress-diff.png4.247 ± 0.0534.1784.3441.00 How?Why it is so fast? The answer is simple:It is written in OCaml and compiled to the native binary executable. OCaml compiler is extremely fast and predictable so it is easy to profile and optimize performance-sensitive code. And also we have direct node.js bindings!It is not doing a useless job under the hood. It is working directly with the low-level bytes buffer and avoids unnecessary memory allocations. It is optimized by profiling produced assembly output 👯‍♀️ Check it outTry it out right now!

A simple closure looks like this:function outer(){ let name = “John Doe”; function inner(){ return name; } return inner();} >> outer() // returns “John Doe” Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Closures can be used in JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Swift, C#, Objective C and a few of other languages. I’ll stick to using simple JavaScript examples as it’s similar to most languages and is easy to understand. I’ll also give Python examples when the JavaScript approach won’t work the same way. outer is a regular function, while inner is a closure since it was defined inside outer and has access to it’s variables. Closures have access to:Their local scope(variables defined inside the inner function)The scope of their outer functionsThe global scopeNow, let’s use a more intuitive example to understand how to use closures:function setGreeting(greeting){ function setName(name){ return ${greeting}, ${name}; } return setName;} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Quite self-explanatory function, the outer function takes a greeting as an argument, and the inner function takes a name as an argument and returns the greeting and name together. You might notice that unlike the first example, in this case, the outer function returns the inner function without calling it - without the parentheses. We’ll see how this affects the code and how we call the functions.>> let welcome = setGreeting(“Welcome”)>> // This sets greeting=“Welcome”>> typeof(welcome) // returns “function”>> welcome // prints f setName(name){…}>> // So welcome is equivalent to setName>> // We can call it with the “name” argument>> welcome(“John”) // prints “Welcome, John”>> welcome(“Joan”) // prints “Welcome, Joan” Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode We can see from this that the first call to setGreeting sets the greeting, and returns the inner function for use. This means we can use welcome just like it were setName. This can be very useful in cases where we need multiple functions that do something similar with different contexts, rather than creating a function for each greeting, we create one function to set the greeting, and an inner function to print the greeting and name. That might sound like a bit much to take in, so let’s look at practical use cases. Creating functions with ContextYou’re filling a form for all graduating students in your department. There’s a lot of details and most of them seem to be general for everyone, like department, isAdult, certificate, country, race, faculty etc. With only very few unique fields like fullName and stateOfOrigin. You could easily create a Closure where all the general fields are set by the outer function, and the inner function only takes the unique fields:function setGeneral(general){ // general is an object containing all general details function setUnique(fullName, stateOfOrigin){ // We use the spread operator “…” // to add fullName and stateOfOrigin to the object fillForm({…general, fullName: fullName, stateOfOrigin: stateOfOrigin }); } return setUnique;}>> cs = {department:“Computer Science”,>> isAdult: true,>> certificate: “B.Sc. Comp”,>> country: “Nigeria”,>> race: “Negro”,>> faculty: “ICT”};>> csStudent = setGeneral(cs);>> // Now we can use csStudent to easily fill forms>> csStudent(“John Doe”, “Lagos”)>> csStudent(“Ciroma Chukwuma”, “Abuja”) Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode The syntax for Python is similar, using a dictionary, we’d update it with the fullName and stateOfOrigin keys using general.update({“fullName”:fullName, “stateOfOrigin”: stateOfOrigin}) Creating private attributesLanguages like Java give you the option to make certain attributes(properties) private. That’s not the case for JavaScript or Python. But we can enforce that using closures.function Person(){ let name = \"“; let age = 0; function setName(name){ name = name; } function getName(){ return name; } function grow(){ age += 1; } function getAge(){ return age; } accessible = {setName: setName, getName: getName, grow: grow, getAge: getAge}; return accessible;}>> john = Person()>> john.setName(”John“)>> john.grow();>> john.grow();>> john.getName() // prints”John\">> john.getAge() // prints 2>> john.name // undefined>> john.age // undefined Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode This is a simple Object Oriented application of closures, which can be used to imitate private attributes. The function returns an object(dictionary) of functions to be accessible from outside the Person function, thus making them accessible by dot notation(i.e john.grow()). While keeping the attributes not returned - name and age - inaccessible outside the Person function.Python dictionary keys can’t be accessed using dots, so here’s a way you can do the same in Pythonfrom types import SimpleNamespacedef Person(): #same code, but in Python def grow(): nonlocal age #python needs to know age is not a local #variable before directly operating on it age += 1 accessible = {}#same thing as well return SimpleNamespace(**accessible)# And that’s it, SimpleNamespace will make them # accessible using dot notation Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode SummaryWith a better understanding of Closures, we can say closures are functions that keep their namespace(variables and or functions) after execution. Making it possible to setup an initial environment first before usage. Keep in mind that closures involve multiple functions, making your code a bit slower and more memory consuming. Try to avoid using them if you’re not getting the benefits peculiar to Closures. Otherwise, enjoy.\n\n\nDEV Community\n\n\n\n2020-11-13 20:11:48\n\nFri Nov 13, 2020 (1 days ago)\n\n\nAvoid using ELSE, write a better code\nAt the beginning of our career, every developer learns the if else conditionals and immediately start using it everywhere. I would say it is normal because the use case is quite simple to understand, “if the condition is true, then do this, otherwise, do something else”.You can even easily identify a code written by a junior developer just reading all the if else used in their code. This is normal and part of the learning process. But as we gain more experience we learn better ways to do the same things.The problem with the else is that it doesn’t have the proper context as it’s own, and you always must back to if to remember what it does. And, in many cases, it is completely useless, as I will show you. The not necessary caseConsider the following code:func multiply(ifExists value: Int?, by: Int = 2) -> Int { if let value = value { return value * by } else { return 0 }} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode It’s a simple Swift function with an optional parameter (the Int? describes it if you are new to Swift).If the parameter is not nil (mainly known as null) multiply it by the second parameter (which is not optional but have a default value 2). But if the parameter is nil then return zero as a result.Wait a minute… is the else statement necessary in this code? It is not. We can easily refactor this to return right after the if statement:func multiply(ifExists value: Int?, by: Int = 2) -> Int { if let value = value { return value * by } return 0} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Much cleaner, right?In Swift, you can also use guard, if you prefer (I like this one):func multiply(ifExists value: Int?, by: Int = 2) -> Int { guard let value = value else { return 0 } return value * by} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode The return earlier caseEvery time you collect user input you will need to validate it before using it. It is very common to see codes like that:func submit(email: String, phone: String) -> Void { if isValidEmail(email) { if isValidPhone(phone) { doSomething(email: email, phone: phone) } else { displayPhoneError() } } else { displayEmailError() }} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Two properties and two else cases. It works, but we have to follow two indentation levels to read every line and understand what is going on.I think it is better to read if we refactor the function to:func submit(email: String, phone: String) -> Void { if !isValidEmail(email) { displayEmailError() return } if !isValidPhone(phone) { displayPhoneError() return } doSomething(email: email, phone: phone)} Enter fullscreen mode Exit fullscreen mode Now we are using return inside if to stop the execution of the function when the input is invalid. This way we maintain our code with just one indentation level, which is easy to read top to bottom. ConclusionThe else statement is a tool we have to write code but most of the time it is useless and you should avoid using it. We have other (and better) options.Every time I write else in my code I immediately ask myself: is it really necessary? And then most of the time I just refactor it to remove it.\n\n\nDatabricks\n\n\n\n2020-11-13 19:00:28\n\nFri Nov 13, 2020 (1 days ago)\n\n\nHow to Evaluate Data Pipelines for Cost to Performance\nLearn best practices for designing and evaluating cost-to-performance benchmarks from Germany’s #1 weather portal.
