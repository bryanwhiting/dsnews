These tuning knobs, the so-called hyperparameters, help us control the behavior of machine learning algorithms when optimizing for performance, finding the right balance between bias and variance. Hyperparameter tuning for performance optimization is an art in itself, and there are no hard-and-fast rules that guarantee best performance on a given dataset. In Part I and Part II, we saw different holdout and bootstrap techniques for estimating the generalization performance of a model. We learned about the bias-variance trade-off, and we computed the uncertainty of our estimates. In this third part, we will focus on different methods of cross-validation for model evaluation and model selection. We will use these cross-validation techniques to rank models from several hyperparameter configurations and estimate how well they generalize to independent datasets.<\/details> | <p style=\"display:none\">2016-10-02 20:00:00<\/p>Sun 10/02<span style=\"color:gray\">\n(-1504d)<\/span> | <a href=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >Dr. Sebastian Raschka<\/a>","<p style=\"display:none\">2016-08-13 20:00:00<\/p><a href=\"https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part2.html\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >Model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning<\/a><details><summary>In this second part of this series, we will look at some advanced techniques for model evaluation an<\/summary>d techniques to estimate the uncertainty of our estimated model performance as well as its variance and stability.

Whether we are applying predictive modeling techniques to our research or business problems, I believe we have one thing in common  &#58; We want to make good predictions! Fitting a model to our training data is one thing, but how do we know that it generalizes well to unseen data? How do we know that it doesn't simply memorize the data we fed it and fails to make good predictions on future samples, samples that it hasn't seen before? And how do we select a good model in the first place? Maybe a different learning algorithm could be better-suited for the problem at hand? Model evaluation is certainly not just the end point of our machine learning pipeline.Before we handle any data, we want to plan ahead and use techniques that are suited for our purposes.

All code samples are Javascript.I find that Readable code is maintainable code.The goal for me as a developer is to write quality code. Every developer on the team, despite his/her skill level, has to be able understand the code by reading it. This helps young developers to be more confident in writing code.      Remove unnecessary code commentsOf course, some code can be very complex. I know that and I have seen that many times. Here I would add proper documentation and code comments.Don't get me wrong. I'm not a fan of code comments or in Javascript JSdoc. Or at least not aslong as I don't need them. ;) I don't need any comments to read that this function takes X amount of arrays and merges them together into a new array.function mergeArrays(...arrays) {  let mergedArray = []  arrays.forEach(array =&gt; {      mergedArray = [...mergedArray, ...array]  })  return mergedArray}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Adding JSdoc to this code does not improve the readability. I expect that my team members know what the spread operator is. And if they don't, they should ask about it during the code reviews.And let's not forget the commented code blocks. Only one solution for that: DELETE THAT CODE. Git has the amazing feature to checkout old code, so why leave it in comments? Please stop making a junkyard of your codebase.      Focus on namingIf you look at the name mergeArrays, it should be very clear that this function combines X amount of arrays into a new one.I know that naming things is hard. And the more complex the function, the harder the naming part will be... I use a rule to make naming easier for myself. Here's how I do it.Imagine a function that merges 2 arrays of numbers and generates a new unique list of numbers. How would you name it? Something like this?function mergeNumberListIntoUniqueList(listOne, listTwo) {  return [...new Set([...listOne, ...listTwo])]}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The name is not that bad, because it does what it says. The problem is that the function is doing 2 things. The more a function does, the more difficult it is to name it. Extracting it to 2 separate functions will make it much easier and more reusable at the same time.function mergeLists(listOne, listTwo) {  return [...listOne, ...listTwo]}function createUniqueList(list) {  return [...new Set(list)]}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Of course it's easy to create a beautiful oneliner without calling a new function. But sometimes, oneliners are not that readable.      If statementsI could not find a name for this problem... See! Naming is hard...But I see this a lot.Problemif(value === 'duck' || value === 'dog' || value === 'cat') {  // ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Solutionconst options = ['duck', 'dog', 'cat'];if (options.includes(value)) {  // ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    By doing this, you create a readable piece of code which looks like an English sentence.If options includes value then ...      Early exitThere are a dozen ways of naming this principle, but I picked the name \"Early exit\".So let me show you a piece of code. I'm sure you saw something like this before.function handleEvent(event) {  if (event) {    const target = event.target;    if (target) {      // Your awesome piece of code that uses target    }  }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here we are trying to check if the object event is not falsy and the property target is available. Now the problem here is that we are already using 2 if statements.Let's see how you could do an \"early exit\" here.function handleEvent(event) {  if (!event || !event.target) {    return;  }  // Your awesome piece of code that uses target}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    By applying the \"early exit\" here, you check if event and event.target is not falsy. It's immediately clear that we are sure that event.target is not falsy. It's also clear that no other code is executed if this statement is falsy.      Destructuring assignmentIn javascript we can destructure objects and arrays.According to the documentation, found on developer.mozilla.org, the descructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it possible to unpack values from arrays, or properties from objects, into distinct variables.Some code samples// Destructuring an objectconst numbers = {one: 1, two: 2};const {one, two} = numbers;console.log(one); // 1console.log(two); // 2// Destructuring an arrayconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];const [one, two] = numbers;console.log(one); // 1console.log(two); // 2    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The problem with destructuring is that it sometimes creates a bad name for a property. The perfect example is fetching data from an API and receiving a response object which has a data property.const url = \"http://localhost:8080/api/v1/organizers/1\"const response = await axios.get(url)const {name} = response.data    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This code sample indicates that you are fetching an organizer with id 1. The organizer object has a name, and you destructure it. Nothing wrong with that.This code works and is fine. But why is the name still name? Will that be the only name property in the whole scope? And from which object is it the name again?Avoid these questions by renaming the property.const url = \"http://localhost:8080/api/v1/organizers/1\"const response = await axios.get(url)const {name: organizerName} = response.data    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This code becomes more readable. Everyone will know that the variable is the name of the organizer.      The boy scout ruleEver heard of the phrase: \"Leave it better than you found it\"?Well, this is exactly what the boy scout rule is. Leave the code better than you found it. Did you find a code smell? Refactor it! Did you find a unused variable? Remove it!I like to compare it with a room cleaning situation. Let's imagine that everyone in your house leaves the dishes on the sink, puts all garbage in the hallway and leaves all the laundry in the bathroom. But every sunday, you have to clean up the whole house and it takes well over 4 hours. Would you like that?I'm sure that the answer is no. So if everyone immediately cleans up little parts of the house, the work will be smaller on sunday.This is the same with codebases. If every small code smell is left in the codebase, no one deletes unused variables, the linter is going crazy and has about 77 warnings. There will be a lot of clean-up to do, but if everyone takes his responsibility and applies the boy scout rule, a lot of the problems will be solved.      Code styleLast but not least. Determine a code style in your team.I don't care if you like single quotes or double quotes, spaces or tabs, trailing comma or no trailing comma. Pick 1 style and stick to it. You can do this with a linter and/or a prettier.There are so many tools to use to fix these kind of issues. My favourite is a pre-commit hook using Husky. Prettier also has a page in their documentation about pre-commit hooks.This pre-commit hook always runs the configured command before every commit. If you configure it in the correct way, it runs the prettier and applies all the rules on all files. This makes sure that the team always has the same code style without any bad code.      ConclusionI know that some rules are obvious and others are not. But as a full-time developer I get to work on different codebases. The importance of these rules only become clear in larger codebases. But that doesn't mean that you should not apply it in your smaller projects. Improving your code quality will help you to be more efficient in your smaller projects. It will also help your team with reading the code and approving your pull requests. As I said, readable code is more maintainable, but it also has many more advantages.If you wish to learn more about clean code, you should read Clean Code by Robert Martin.

The principle’s name sounded very strange to me. I judged the book by its cover, and I convinced myself that I wouldn’t grasp it. Eventually, it turned out that it was one of the easiest and straight forward principles in SOLID principles.So, let’s start our journey by putting a simple definition for the Liskov Substitution Principle:It’s the ability to replace any object of a parent class with any object of one of its child classes without affecting the correctness of the program.I know it sounds strange to you but let’s break it into pieces. Suppose we have a program that has a parent class. The parent class has some child classes who inherit from. If we decided to create some objects from the parent class in our program, we’ve to be able to replace any one of them with any object of any child class, and the program should work as expected without any errors.In other words, we have to be able to substitute objects of a parent class with objects of child classes without causing the program to break. That’s why the principle has the keyword ‘substitution’ in its name. As for Liskov, it’s the name of the scientist Barbara Liskov who developed a scientific definition for that principle. You can read this article Liskov substitution principle on Wikipedia for more information about that definition.Now, let’s try to link the definition we’ve just discussed to a famous example to understand the principle.Bird is a class which has the two methods eat() and fly(). It represents a base class that any type of bird can extend.public class Bird {    public void eat() {        System.out.println(\"I can eat.\");    }    public void fly() {        System.out.println(\"I can fly.\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Swan is a type of bird that can eat and fly. Hence, it has to extend the Bird class.public class Swan extends Bird {    @Override    public void eat() {        System.out.println(\"OMG! I can eat pizza!\");    }    @Override    public void fly() {        System.out.println(\"I believe I can fly!\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Main is the main class of our program which contains its logic. It has two methods, letBirdsFly(List&lt;Bird&gt; birds) and main(String[] args). The first method takes a list of birds as a parameter and invokes their fly methods. The second one creates the list and passes it to the first.public class Main {    public static void letBirdsFly(List&lt;Bird&gt; birds) {        for(Bird bird: birds) {            bird.fly();        }    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        List&lt;Bird&gt; birds = new ArrayList&lt;Bird&gt;();        birds.add(new Bird());        letBirdsFly(birds);    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The program simply creates a list of birds and lets them fly. If you try to run this program, it will output the following statement:I can fly.    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now, let’s try to apply the definition of this principle to our main method and see what happens. We are going to replace the Bird object with the Swan object.public static void main(String[] args) {    List&lt;Bird&gt; birds = new ArrayList&lt;Bird&gt;();           birds.add(new Swan());    letBirdsFly(birds);}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If we try to run the program after applying the changes, it will output the following statement:I believe I can fly!    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We can see that the principle applies to our code perfectly. The program works as expected without any errors or problems. But, what if we tried to extend the Bird class by a new type of bird that cannot fly?public class Penguin extends Bird {    @Override    public void eat() {        System.out.println(\"Can I eat taco?\");    }    @Override    public void fly() {        throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\"Help! I cannot fly!\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We can check whether the principle still applied to our code or not by adding a Penguin object to the list of birds and run the code.public static void main(String[] args) {    List&lt;Bird&gt; birds = new ArrayList&lt;Bird&gt;();           birds.add(new Swan());    birds.add(new Penguin());    letBirdsFly(birds);}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    I believe I can fly!Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: Help! I cannot fly!    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Ops! it didn’t work as expected!We can see that with the Swan object, the code worked perfectly. But with the Penguin object, the code threw UnsupportedOperationException. This violates the Liskov Substitution Principle as the Bird class has a child that didn’t use inheritance correctly, hence caused a problem. The Penguin tries to extend the flying logic, but it can’t fly!We can fix this problem using the following if check:public static void letBirdsFly(List&lt;Bird&gt; birds) {    for(Bird bird: birds) {        if(!(bird instanceof Penguin)) {            bird.fly();        }    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    But this solution is considered a bad practice, and it violates the Open-Closed Principle. Imagine if we add another three types of birds that cannot fly. The code is going to become a mess. Notice also that one of the definitions for the Liskov Substitution Principle, which is developed by Robert C. Martin is:Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.This is not the case with our solution, as we’re trying to know the type of the Bird object to avoid the misbehavior of the non-flying birds.One of the clean solutions to solve this issue and refollow the principle is to separate the flying logic in another class.public class Bird {    public void eat() {        System.out.println(\"I can eat.\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    public class FlyingBird extends Bird {    public void fly() {        System.out.println(\"I can fly.\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    public class Swan extends FlyingBird {    @Override    public void eat() {        System.out.println(\"OMG! I can eat pizza!\");    }    @Override    public void fly() {        System.out.println(\"I believe I can fly!\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    public class Penguin extends Bird {    @Override    void eat() {        System.out.println(\"Can I eat taco?\");    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now we can edit the letBirdsFly method to support flying birds only.public class Main {    public static void letBirdsFly(List&lt;FlyingBird&gt; flyingBirds) {        for(FlyingBird flyingBird: flyingBirds) {            flyingBird.fly();        }    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        List&lt;FlyingBird&gt; flyingBirds = new ArrayList&lt;FlyingBird&gt;();             flyingBirds.add(new Swan());        letBirdsFly(flyingBirds);    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The reason we forced the letBirdsFly method to accept flying birds only is to guarantee that any substitution for the FlyingBird will be able to fly. Now the program works as expected and outputs the following statements:I believe I can fly!    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    You can see that the Liskov Substitution Principle is about using the inheritance relationship in the correct manner. You’ve to create subtypes of some parent if and only if they’re going to implement its logic properly without causing any problems.We’ve reached the end of this journey, but we still have another two principles to cover. So take your time reading about this principle and make sure that you understand it before moving on.

But I wanted to introduce you to pygame, a fun li<\/summary>ttle module capable enough to make simple and fun 2d games in python, so here I am ...To get started, you must have python and pip installed on your system, You can get more info at hereTo verify that python is installed, on the terminal, run# check if python is installedpython --version#check if pip is installedpip --version    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If you get something in return that means you are successful ...Now it's time to install pygame, just runpip install pygame    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If you faced any trouble, you can check this pageAlternatively, if you don't wanna go through all this setup, you can use repl.it , it has an online pygame compiler that you can usecheck it out here      Getting StartedWe can finally start writing some code, You can use any favorite ide of yours ... vscode, sublime, atom,pycharm, brackets, etc ... It doesn't matter ...just make a new python file in any directory and name it anything you want ...The first job is going to be to import pygame and initialize our game windowimport sys,randomimport pygame # initialize pygame pygame.init()# constants that store our screen width and height ,# they are in pixelsWIN_X = 800WIN_Y = 600# setting up our game window in pygame with # our screen width and height constants as tupleWIN = pygame.display.set_mode((WIN_X,WIN_Y))# setting the caption of our game# or more precisely the label that# you will see on the game windowpygame.display.set_caption('snake game')    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Let's discuss the code above,First, we import pygame and some other local modules, then use the init method on pygame to start our game or start pygameWe make two variables or constants, WIN_X and WIN_Y to store our screen dimensions or our screen width and screen height,The reason we need this is that pygame creates a game window and we need to declare the width and height of it, you can choose any width and height, I am choosing 800x600Next, we set up our game window, or tell pygame to initialize our game window with pygame.display.set_mode() method passing in our screen dimensions in a tupleIn the end, I just set up a caption or label for the game window using pygame.display.set_mode() method passing in the caption string, you can pass any string you want here ...Now if you run this code, you will see the game screen for a short time, and then it exits the program ...Can you guess why this happens, well cause we didn't define any game loop ...A game loop is just an infinite loop, that goes on forever until the user exits or closes it ... As we didn't define any game loop, the window was visible for a moment, but then the program ended, and so the game screen was also gone...Let's go ahead and implement our game loop#importing modulesimport sys,randomimport pygame pygame.init()WIN_X = 800WIN_Y = 600WIN = pygame.display.set_mode((WIN_X,WIN_Y))pygame.display.set_caption('snake game')#initializing pygame.time.Clock() which controls#The FPS or frame per second or more explicitly#For how many times per second our game loop #below should runCLOCK = pygame.time.Clock()#our infinite game loopwhile 1:   #checking for events in pygame.event.get() which   #returns the event that occurs like    #any key presses or user clicking the   #exit , maximize , minimize button   for event in pygame.event.get():        #here we are checking if user has clicked the exit button        #by checking if the event.type is pygame.QUIT         #which is predefined in pygame as the exit button        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:            #if user clicked the exit button , quit the game            #and exit out of the program            pygame.quit()            sys.exit()        #using CLOCK variable mentioned above and using        #tick method on it passing in the fps        #this means that this loop will run         #25 times per second,         #feel free to change the value        CLOCK.tick(25)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now if you run the program, the window is going to stay until you press the exit button, congrats if you could follow up on this ...In the above, I just wrote a simple infinite while loop, then I wrote another for loop which checks for events like mouse-clicking, hover and others, the method pygame.event.get() returns the events that are occurring currently, there, I am checking if event.type is equal to the event pygame.QUIT or in other words did the user click the cross button, if that's true, quit the program, else continue to run ...You also might have seen the CLOCK variable I declared, it just initializes pygame.time.Clock() and using it, in the while loop, I used CLOCK.tick(25), which just tells pygame to run the while loop 25 times per second, you are more than welcome to change the number ...      Planning Core Game logicNow it's time to plan our core game logic, so we will have these 3 functions, main,  main_menu,  game_over, they represent different scenes of our game, for now, we will only focus on the main function or the main game logic ...So first of all, how we will render and move our snake, that's the first and most obvious thing to do ...Well, our snake is going to be a square, I mean a collection of squares, and whenever he can eat any food, the number of squares in the snake's body will increase, now how we will store these squares,  and how we will track the position of the square ...To store the squares of the body of the snake, the data structure that comes into my mind first is a list, so we can create a list of the snake body, and for each element of that list, we will render a square-like shape... Now the squares itself are going to be a list, cause in pygame, to draw a rectangle or square, we will need it's x coordinate,y coordinate and it's the width and it's height, Now for the snake position, we could introduce another list which will contain the snakes starting x and y coordinate, let's say it's [100,50], And then we will increment or decrement it by the snake's speed in the game loop, we would also need a direction variable to track if the snake is moving up, down, left or right... One thing to note is that the snake pos list will be pushed to the snake body list after each round of the loop, and we will pop the first element in the snake body list after every round in the loop, The reason why we do this will be clear once we start implementing it, snake pos will also help us to keep track of where the snake is going so if the snake hit's the boundaries, or eats a fruit, we can know that and also changing the direction of the snake...Now when the user click's W, the snake will go up, for A snake goes the left, D for right, and S for down, You can change these controls or introduce new controls if you want...For the fruit, we will create a single square which is going to look like a fruit, You can also use images if you want... We will spawn these fruits randomly on the screen using the random module...Now for the snake, I could create a snake class and for the fruit, I could create a fruit class, also I could create a game object class from which all game objects are gonna inherit, but for simplicity, I am not going to do that, instead, I will just store them in relevant variables...      Implementing the game logicWe can start implementing the logic discussed above, first, let's start creating our main function, I am going to shift my game loop thereimport sys, randomimport pygamepygame.init()WIN_X = 800WIN_Y = 600WIN = pygame.display.set_mode((WIN_X,WIN_Y))pygame.display.set_caption('snake game')#main functiondef main():    CLOCK = pygame.time.Clock()    #variable to

pygame.display.update()        #withouth this , you wouldn't see anything on the screen        #You should write all your rendering logic or code        #that renders things to screen before this line        pygame.display.update()        CLOCK.tick(25)#caliing the main functionmain()    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here, I just shifted my code to the main function, made a snake_body and snake_pos variable, in the game loop, I rendered the snake, read the comments if you can't understand, the code should be self-explanatory, You may be wondering about the coordinate system in pygame, how will pygame draw our objects on the screen, well pygame coordinate system starts from the top leftmost corner, not the bottom leftmost corner like we are used to,So when we say 20 on the x, 10 on the y  in pygame , it means go 20 to the right from the top leftmost corner and 10 to the down from the top ...If you run the code you should see something like thisWell we can see the snake so that's great news, but the snake is not moving, it's just a static snake on the screen, well that's boring, let's make it moveat the end of the main function before we run pygame.display.update() add the following code        #remember the direction variable declared at the start        #of main function , we are checking if direction is        #up,down,right or left        if direction == 'right':            #if direction is right , add 10 to x coordinate            #of snake_pos , adding to x coordinate makes things            #move right            snake_pos[0] += 10        elif direction == 'left':            #if direction is left, deduct 10 from x coordinate            #of snake_pos , deducting from x coordinate             #makes things move left            snake_pos[0] -= 10        elif direction == 'up':            #if direction is up, add 10 to y coordinate            #of snake_pos , adding to y coordinate             #makes things move up            snake_pos[1] -= 10        elif direction == 'down':            #if direction is down, deduct 10 from y coordinate            #of snake_pos , deducting from y coordinate             #makes things move down            snake_pos[1] += 10    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If you run the code now, absolutely nothing is going to happen, the snake does not move, why is that?Because we render squares in snake_body, we don't render the snake_pos, and here we are adjusting snake_posSo what to do now, well to make the snake move, we can insert our snake_pos to the beginning of the list, let's see what happens, below the code where we check directions and before pygame.display.update() add this#appending snake_pos to snake_body#make sure to convert snake_pos#explicitly to list or else #it won't worksnake_body.append(list(snake_pos))    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now if you run the program, you will see something like this,The snake keeps growing endlessly, but we only want our snake to grow once he eats fruit, we have to fix this...But why it's behaving this way, well we are appending snake_pos to snake_body, but not removing the old squares from the snake_body, so it's growing endlessly, one thing we can do is remove the oldest square by removing the first item from the list, Below the code where we append snake_pos to snake_body, add the following#remove the first element from snake_bodysnake_body.pop(0)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now you should see something like thisSo our snake is moving at last, but it's only moving the right, well that's not what we want, let's add some controls        #The for loop where we check for events        for event in pygame.event.get():            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:                pygame.quit()                sys.exit()            #here , we are storing pygame.key_pressed() in             #keys variable , pygame.key_pressed() returns what key            #The user has pressed and we can check that below             keys= pygame.key.get_pressed()            #Now in keys , we check if pygame.K_w is true            #what does that mean            #well pygame.K_w represents w in pygame            #and pygame.K_UP represents the up arrow key            #if keys[pygame.K_w] or keys[pygame.K_UP]             #returns true or in other words if the            #user has clicked the w key or up arrow            #we change direction to up            #we then also check clicks on s,a,d,down            #arrow key,left arrow key and change            #the direction accordingly            if (keys[pygame.K_w] or keys[pygame.K_UP]):                direction = 'up'            if (keys[pygame.K_s] or keys[pygame.K_DOWN]):                direction = 'down'            if (keys[pygame.K_d] or keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]):                direction = 'right'            if (keys[pygame.K_a] or keys[pygame.K_LEFT]):                direction = 'left'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If you run the code now, you should be seeing something like thisSo we got our snake moving, now one thing I would like to fix right away is that snake moving instantaneously ...What do I mean by that, well if the snake is going up, then when we press down arrow key or s, the snake goes over its own body in a very strange way which should not happen, the same thing occurs when the snake is in left and snake goes right or snake is in down and snake goes up, let me show you what I meanSaw that right, well luckily it has an easy fix, when we are changing the snake's direction, we can check if the snake is already in the opposite directionSuppose the snake's direction is up, the user wants to go down now, but the snake is going up and we don't want any instantaneous movement, so we'll not go downThe place where we are changing direction in the for loop, change those if check's to this            #preventing instanteous movement            #here we are checking if user and wants to            #to go up , but snake's direction is not            #'down' which is opposite of up , change            #the direction            if (keys[pygame.K_w] or keys[pygame.K_UP]) and direction != 'down':                direction = 'up'            if (keys[pygame.K_s] or keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) and direction != 'up':                direction = 'down'            if (keys[pygame.K_d] or keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) and direction != 'left':                direction = 'right'            if (keys[pygame.K_a] or keys[pygame.K_LEFT]) and direction != 'right':                direction = 'left'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    With that, the bug gets fixed.But now, the snake can go through the boundaries of our screen, and keep going endlessly Well we can exit our application if the snake hit's the boundaries of the window, later on, we will introduce a game_over and main_menu sceneAt the end of the game loop ,  add this        #checking if x coordinate of snaake is smaller than 0,        #if that's true , than snake has crossed left side        #of screen , we also check if snakes x coordinate is         #greater than our screen , if that happens , snake        #has crossed right side of the screen ,        if snake_pos[0] &lt;=0 or snake_pos[0] &gt;= WIN_X:            sys.exit()        #checking if y coordinate of snake is smaller than 0,        #if that's true than the snake has crossed the upper side        #of the screen, we also check if snakes y coordinate is         #greater than our screens y coordinate,        #if that happens, snake        #has crossed the lower side of the screen,        if snake_pos[1] &lt;=0 or snake_pos[1] &gt;= WIN_Y:            sys.exit()    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This should work however it might be a bit off, might not look pixel-perfect, we can make it better by adding some pixels, worked for me        if snake_pos[0]+10 &lt;=0 or snake_pos[0] &gt;= WIN_X:            sys.exit()        if snake_pos[1]+10 &lt;=0 or snake_pos[1] &gt;= WIN_Y:            sys.exit()    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    much better,      Bringing the fruits inNow let's add some grapesfor The grapes, we can make two variablesfruit_pos and fruit_spawnfruit_pos is going to be the pos of the grape or fruit, it's going to be positioned randomly on the screen, next we have fruit_spawn which checks if new fruit is to be generated, it's going to be true by defaultAt the start of the main function, before the game loop, add this    fruit_pos = [0,0]    fruit_spawn = True    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then in the game loop, before pygame.display.update(), add this line#generating a random position for the grape#for the x coordinate its going to be from#range 40 to screen_width-40 #i am not starting from 0 as the grape  can#be very close to the boundaries then#same logic for y coordinatefruit_pos = [random.randrange(40,WIN_X-40),random.randrange(40,WIN_Y-40)]#Drawing the fruit to the screen using #pygame.draw.rect()pygame.draw.rect(WIN ,(138,43,226),(fruit_pos[0],fruit_pos[1],10,10))    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here, we are generating a random position for the grape and drawing a 10x10 Rect.If you run the code now, it should look something like thisWell, its kind of keep on generating grapes and not stopping at all, The reason this occurs is that in every round in the while loop, we are changing the fruit_pos and rendering it, To fix this we can use our fruit_spawn variable, which was set to true initiallyThe place where we wrote our grape spawning logic, cut that and use this        #if fruit spawn is true , change fruit_pos        #and make fruit_spawn false        if fruit_spawn:            fruit_pos = [random.randrange(40,WIN_X-40),random.randrange(40,WIN_Y-40)]            fruit_spawn = False        pygame.draw.rect(WIN ,(138,43,226),(fruit_pos[0],fruit_pos[1],10,10))    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now, only one fruit should be visible,If you notice, you will see that we only have one fruit, we arejust changing its positionBut the snake still can't eat any fruit, let's add thatAt the game loop , before pygame.display.update() , add this        if pygame.Rect(snake_pos[0],snake_pos[1],10,10).colliderect(pygame.Rect(fruit_pos[0],fruit_pos[1],10,10)):            fruit_spawn=True            score += 5    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Let me just directly describe what I did instead of commenting,well I am checking if snake_pos collides with fruit_posNow the way I did it looks strange, So let me explain thatin pygame, we have this thing called Rect, More Info here, rects make collision detection easy, You can also use rect on the image, any rectangular object works, It can also be circular, But collision detection will not be that great.Now to make a rect, we have to use Pygame.Rect()methodWe have to pass in the x coordinate as the first argument, y coordinate as the 2nd argument, and width and height as the 3rd and 4th argument respectivelyIn our case, we first pass the snakes x coordinate, y coordinate, it's width and heightNow rects have a lot of methods available, one is colliderect(), This method takes another Pygame.Rect() as argument and checks if they two collide with each otherIn our case, we pass fruit_pos transforming as Rect to the colliderect method.If this returned true, fruit_spawn will be true, so new fruits will be generated and the score will be increasedWith that out of the way you should see something like this But our snake doesn't grow, why is that, how we can make him grow?Well, remember that we were always removing the first item from snake_body after we append snake_pos to snake_bodyWhat if we only remove the first item in the list when the snake could not eat any grape, if the snake collides with the rect, we don't remove the first element from snake_bodyThe place where we remove the first element from snake_body, cut that part, then got the part where we check collision between fruit and snake, change that to this        if pygame.Rect(snake_pos[0],snake_pos[1],10,10).colliderect(pygame.Rect(fruit_pos[0],fruit_pos[1],10,10)):            fruit_spawn=True            score += 5        else:            snake_body.pop(0)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    And now the snake will start to grow,But why is this working, When we first start our game, snake_body should be like thissnake_body=[[200,70] , [190 , 70] , [180,70]]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    in the game loop, we add snake_pos to it and remove first elementThen it should be something like thissnake_body=[[190, 70], [180, 70], [210, 70]]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here the snake is 3 squares long, what happens if we don't remove the first element next timesnake_body=[[190, 70], [180, 70], [210, 70], [220, 70]]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The snake is 4  squares longNow we face another problem when the snake collides with his own body, We have to stop the game if that happensIn the game loop, add this line        for square in snake_body[1:]:            if pygame.Rect(square[0],square[1],10,10).colliderect(pygame.Rect(snake_pos[0],snake_pos[1],10,10)):                game_over(score)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now, what did I do here?First of I am looping through the snake_body and checking if snake_pos collides with the other squares.Now why I excluded the last element in snake_body using snake_body[:-1]It's a bit confusing but think of the last element as the head of the snake, here we are checking if the head or snake_pos collides with other parts of the body, But if we include the last element in the list, we will be checking if head collides with the head when the for loop reaches there, cause the last element in the snake_body is going to be snake_pos and we would be checking if snake_pos collides with snake_pos or if head collides with head, which is always true.With that our game is almost ready      Displaying scoreWe now have to display our score,In pygame, to show text, first, we have to load a fontat the start of the file, after importing pygame and before the main function, add thisfont = pygame.font.SysFont('comicsans',40)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here we are loading a system font using pygame.font.Sysfont() which takes font as first argument and size as 2ndI chose comicsans, u can choose other system fonts like timesnewromanNext, we also have to use this font now ...At the game loop, before pygame.display.update() add these two lines        #setting the font up        score_font = font.render(f'{score}' , True , (255,255,255))        #declaring position of the font to be in center        #in x coordinate and 30 in y        font_pos = score_font.get_rect(center=(WIN_X//2-40 , 30))        WIN.blit(score_font , font_pos)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    So what did I do here?first I made a score_font variable, and you can name this anything you want by the way, and set it equal to font.renderNow the font is the variable we declared above, so change that to whatever you named itNow in this font, we have a render method, this takes the string we want to show as 1st argument, in our case its the score, but the score is a number and 1st argument has to be a string and so I changed it to a string using f strings in python. The next argument can be set to either true or false, your wish, 3rd argument is the color in RGB, I chose white.Now only this won't show text on the screen, we have to Blit it.So that's why, I used WIN.blit() which takes the thing to blit or display as 1st argument which in our case was a font, and a tuple or list which takes the x and y coordinates, I already declared a font_pos above which is a center position at the top of the screen. If you wanna know how to center text in pygame, there are a lot of ways. You can check this StackOverflow thread for more details.Let's run the game now ..................That's a fully functioning snake game we have here.      The main menu and game over sceneAnd Before I end this post, let's implement the main menu and game over scene...Let's start with the main menuIn our game code, before the main function, put this code#The main menudef main_menu():    #creating seperate game loop for the main_menu    while 1:        #listening for events        for event in pygame.event.get():            #you know what this does            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:                pygame.quit()                sys.exit()            #IF THE user clicks anywhere in the screen            #call the main function , start the game            if event.type == pygame.MOUSEBUTTONDOWN:                main()        #nothing new here        WIN.fill((0,0,0))        #showing the message         #'Press anywhere to start'        # at the center of the screen        main_menu_message = font.render('Press anywhere to start the game' , True , (255,255,255))        font_pos = main_menu_message.get_rect(center=(WIN_X//2, WIN_Y//2))        WIN.blit(main_menu_message , font_pos)        pygame.display.update()    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Ok, Let's go through this quick. In this function, we wrote another game loop and another check for pygame.event.get()If the user clicks anywhere, the main function will be called Which means the game will start, We also display a message 'Press anywhere to start at the center of the screenNow at the end of our code, where we call main(), insteadmain_menu()    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We are almost done, The thing which is left is the game_over sceneLet's quickly go through that#game over scene, this takes the score to display as #the argumentdef game_over(score):        #I won't explain these again        while 1:            for event in pygame.event.get():                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:                    pygame.quit()                    sys.exit()            WIN.fill((0,0,0))            #showing 'You lost' in red color            game_over_message = font.render('You Lost' , True , (255,0,0))            #showing 'You score was SCORE'            game_over_score = font.render(f'Your Score was {score}' , True , (255,255,255))            font_pos_message = game_over_message.get_rect(center=(WIN_X//2, WIN_Y//2))            font_pos_score = game_over_score.get_rect(center=(WIN_X//2, WIN_Y//2+40))            WIN.blit(game_over_message , font_pos_message)            WIN.blit(game_over_score , font_pos_score)            pygame.display.update()            #here what we are doing is we            #use time.sleep() to stop our             #program for 3 seconds ,            #don't forget to import time module at            #the top ...            #after 3 seconds, we call our main_menu()            time.sleep(3)            main_menu()    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    What the game_over() does is show that you have lost and your score. Pauses the program for 3 seconds and then just calls main_menu()Now in the main function, whenever we die, we are calling sys.exit(), instead of that, call game_over() passing in the scoreYour main function should be close to thisdef main():    CLOCK = pygame.time.Clock()    snake_pos=[200,70]    snake_body=[[200,70] , [200-10 , 70] , [200-(2*10),70]]    fruit_pos = [0,0]    fruit_spawn = True    direction = 'right'    score=0    CLOCK = pygame.time.Clock()    while 1:        for event in pygame.event.get():            if event.type == pygame.QUIT:                pygame.quit()                sys.exit()            keys= pygame.key.get_pressed()            if (keys[pygame.K_w] or keys[pygame.K_UP]) and direction != 'down':                direction = 'up'            if (keys[pygame.K_s] or keys[pygame.K_DOWN]) and direction != 'up':                direction = 'down'            if (keys[pygame.K_d] or keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]) and direction != 'left':                direction = 'right'            if (keys[pygame.K_a] or keys[pygame.K_LEFT]) and direction != 'right':                direction = 'left'        WIN.fill((0,0,0))        for square in snake_body:            pygame.draw.rect(WIN ,(255, 255, 0), (square[0],square[1],10,10))        if direction == 'right':            snake_pos[0] += 10        elif direction == 'left':            snake_pos[0] -= 10        elif direction == 'up':            snake_pos[1] -= 10        elif direction == 'down':            snake_pos[1] += 10        snake_body.append(list(snake_pos))        if fruit_spawn:            fruit_pos = [random.randrange(40,WIN_X-40),random.randrange(40,WIN_Y-40)]            fruit_spawn = False        pygame.draw.rect(WIN ,(138,43,226),(fruit_pos[0],fruit_pos[1],10,10))        score_font = font.render(f'{score}' , True , (255,255,255))        font_pos = score_font.get_rect(center=(WIN_X//2-40 , 30))        WIN.blit(score_font , font_pos)        if pygame.Rect(snake_pos[0],snake_pos[1],10,10).colliderect(pygame.Rect(fruit_pos[0],fruit_pos[1],10,10)):            fruit_spawn=True            score += 5        else:            snake_body.pop(0)        for square in snake_body[:-1]:            if pygame.Rect(square[0],square[1],10,10).colliderect(pygame.Rect(snake_pos[0],snake_pos[1],10,10)):                game_over(score)        if snake_pos[0]+10 &lt;=0 or snake_pos[0] &gt;= WIN_X:            game_over(score)        if snake_pos[1]+10 &lt;=0 or snake_pos[1] &gt;= WIN_Y:            game_over(score)        pygame.display.update()        CLOCK.tick(25)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    With this, We should have a complete snake game...The complete code can be found at my GitHub here      ConclusionSo here you have it...

Like many .NET developers, I was quick to download it and give it a test run. This article discusses some of the most exciting new features in .NET 5.      What is .NET 5?.NET is Microsoft's developer platform, used to write applications for a range of different applications, including web, mobile and desktop applications. .NET is the predominant platform for developers that write in the C#, F# and VB languages.Originally the .NET Framework was designed to run only on Windows machines, giving it significant limitations. That all changed in 2016, when the first version of .NET Core was released, allowing developers to write cross-platform applications for almost any type of device.However, both the .NET Framework and .NET Core continued to be developed simultaneously. Until now. .NET 5 represents the unification to the two separate frameworks, bringing together the best features of both into one single framework. Going forward, Microsoft will only continue to update this new unified framework, starting with .NET 5.      Best New .NET 5 Features      C# 9.NET 5 brings along with it updates to the C# (C# 9) and F# (F# 5) languages. I apologise to F# developers that I don't have experience in F# so will be leaving it out of this review.      Top-level statementsAnyone the has written any C# code would admit that there can be quite a lot of boilerplate code, even to make a very simple application, which can be unnecessary and confusing. For example, the most basic Hello World program would look like this:using System;namespace MyConsoleApp{    class Program     {        static void Main(string[] args)        {            Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");        }    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Top-level statements makes some assumptions about your code, that allow you to simplify it. For example, if no namespace is declared, it is assumed that the global namespace is being used. Also, if not specified, it is assumed that the code belongs in the Main method of the Program class. Therefore, using top level statements, the same program can be simplified to:using System;Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World\");    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    In my opinion, the intent is much clearer here, with all of the boilerplate removed. To learn more about top-level statements, this article is very useful.      Record typesA pattern that is becoming more and more popular in programming is that of immutability. This is the idea that, once an object is created, it cannot be changed (or mutated). This helps make more reliable code, since the potential for unexpected side effects is reduced.C# 9 introduces Record types, which act as immutable complex reference types. So, for example., we could define a Person record:public record Person{    public Person(string firstName, string lastName)    {        FirstName = firstName;        LastName = lastName;    }    public string FirstName { get; }    public string LastName { get; }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The values of record type properties cannot be changed once the object has been initialised.Another nice feature of record types is that they can be compared in the same way that value types are. That is, if the values within the record are equal, then the records themselves are considered equal. This is different to normal reference types, which determine equality based on if they refer to the same instance. For example:// if Person is a classvar sam1 = new Person(\"Sam\", \"Walpole\");var sam2 = new Person(\"Sam\", \"Walpole\");sam1 == sam2 // false// if Person is a recordvar sam1 = new Person(\"Sam\", \"Walpole\");var sam2 = new Person(\"Sam\", \"Walpole\");sam1 == sam2 // true    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    There are some other nice features of Record types, which can be explored further here.      Init-only settersIt is common to initialise classes in the following way:var person = new Person{    FirstName = \"Sam\",    LastName = \"Walpole\"};    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    However, you may have experienced cases where you want to have no setter or a private setter for a particular property, if you do not want it's value to be changed after initialisation. The problem with this is the above example no longer works as it relies on having a public setter available. This means that you have to resort to including all initialisable properties in the constructor of you class, which for complex classes can become long and difficult to understand easily.C# 9 introduces init-only setters, which allows the above syntax to be used for initialisation, but afterwards the property does not have a setter and is therefore unmodifiable.public class Person{    public string FirstName { get; init; }    public string LastName { get; init; }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          .NET MAUI.NET MAUI stands for .NET Multi-platform App UI and is a user interface framework that allows the same code to be reused to deploy Android, iOS, macOS and Windows, all in one project..NET MAUI supports the well-know MVVM (Model View ViewModel) pattern, as well as a new MVU (Model View Update Pattern). To learn more about .NET MAUI, please check here.      Entity Framework Core 5.0While not technically officially part of .NET 5, EF Core is the go-to ORM for many .NET developers, and it's release cycle coincides with that of .NET 5.There are a whole bunch of updates coming to EF Core 5, all of which can be found here. However, below is the update that I'm most excited about.      Many-to-many relationship mappingThis has been a big frustration for users of EF Core for a long time now. In previous versions of EF Core, in order to configure a many-to-many relationship, it was necessary to explicitly create a class for the joining table, that had no purpose other than holding the foreign keys.public class Post{    public int Id { get; set; }    public string Title { get; set; }    public string Text { get; set; {    public ICollection&lt;PostTag&gt; PostTags { get; set; }}public class Tag{    public int Id { get; set; }    public string Name { get; set; }    public ICollection&lt;PostTag&gt; PostTags { get; set; }}public class PostTag{    public int Id { get; set; }    public int PostId { get; set; }    public Post Post { get; set; }    public int TagId { get; set; }    public Tag Tag { get; set; }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    As you can see, this is an awful lot of additional boilerplate code, which can be very frustrating when you have lots of many-to-many relationships to deal with.Luckily, in EF Core 5, many-to-many relationships can be configured simply by having a collection property on both entities, eliminating the need for that joining class.public class Post{    public int Id { get; set; }    public string Title { get; set; }    public string Text { get; set; {    public ICollection&lt;Tag&gt; Tags { get; set; }}public class Tag{    public int Id { get; set; }    public string Name { get; set; }    public ICollection&lt;Post&gt; Posts { get; set; }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          ConclusionAbove I have discussed some of the new features in .NET 5 that I am most excited about. .NET 5 brings with it a whole host of other big changes, so no doubt there are features that I've missed.

Very good question so lets dive in!      Passion is dangerousTo understand the craftsman mindset we first have to understand why passion is not always the best approach for your career. In the book So good they cant ignore you from Cal Newport Newport talks about:The Passion MindsetThe Craftsman MindsetThe Passion Mindset is pretty popular. You might know it. Sentences like Just follow your passion everything else will come automatically.Do what you love and the money just fly into your arms.In the book Cal Newport interviewed a lot of people to see if that mindset is really the way to a long, satisfying career.Spoiler: NopeThe passion mindset describes following:What can the world offer me?Most people just focus on that and forget that they has to offer something in return. Skills that they can offer the world in exchange.Poeple with that mindset always think that their current job is not enough. Somewhere out in this world might be a job that can offer them more. They are never completely satisfied.And now lets have a look into the craftsman mindset.      The Craftsman MindsetThis approach has a completely different approach. It says following:What can i offer the world?And with that in their head this poeple train themselfes to become better. To learn new skills and train them to perfection. They become so good they cant be ignored. In the book Cal Newport met many poeple with this mindset and the interesting thing is that most of them dont follow a specific passion. They just focusing on getting better and learn valuable skills they can offer. And by becoming so good they developed a passion for it.So here is the core:Become so good at something and the passion will come!      Career CapitalCal Newport calls this valuable skills Career Capital. Skills that you can offer the world. Skills that are high in demand. If you want a job where you can be creative, free and that you love you have to offer something in return. Its simply demand and supply.You have to practice. A LOT. Always challenge yourself even if you feel uncomfortable with that. After some time you will overcome this point and develop a passion while you getting better and better.      ConclusionThis was a quick overview from the Craftsman Mindset. I highly recommend to read So good they cant ignore you from Cal Newport. Im currently reading it and its amazing and i will definitely write a complete book review when i finished it.I love to talk about stuff like this so feel free to leave me a comment.In the mean time you can check out my book review Atomic Habits from James Clear.Stay connected to me and my content on Twitter.Stay healthy guys and see you next time!<\/details> | <p style=\"display:none\">2020-11-14 13:51:47<\/p>Sat 11/14 | <a href=\"https://dev.to\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >DEV Community<\/a>","<p style=\"display:none\">2020-11-14 13:39:41<\/p><a href=\"https://dev.to/techschoolguru/mock-db-for-testing-http-api-in-go-and-achieve-100-coverage-4pa9\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >Mock DB for testing HTTP API in Go and achieve 100% coverage<\/a><details><summary>If you have trouble isolating unit test data to avoid conflicts, think about mock DB! In this articl<\/summary>e, we will learn how to use Gomock to generate stubs for the DB interface, which helps us write API unit tests faster, cleaner, and easily achieve 100% coverage.Here's:Link to the full series playlist on YoutubeAnd its Github repository      Why mocking DBIn the previous lectures, we have learned how to implement RESTful HTTP APIs in Go. When it comes to testing these APIs, some people might choose to connect to the real database, while some others might prefer to just mocking it. So which approach should we use?Well, I would say it’s up to you. But for me, mocking is better because of the following reasons:First, it helps us to write independent tests more easily because each test will use its own separate mock DB to store data, so there will be no conflicts between them. If you use a real DB, all tests will read and write data to the same place, so it would be harder to avoid conflicts, especially in a big project with a large code base.Second, our tests will run much faster since they don’t have to spend time talking to the DB and waiting for the queries to run. All actions will be performed in memory and within the same process.The third and very important reason for mocking DB is: It allows us to write tests that achieve 100% coverage. With a mock DB, we can easily set up and test some edge cases, such as an unexpected error, or a connection lost, which would be impossible to achieve if we use a real DB.OK, that sounds great. But is it good enough to test our API with just a mock DB? Can we be confident that our codes will still perform well when a real DB is plugged in?Yes, absolutely! Because our code that talks to the real DB is already tested carefully in the previous lecture.So all we need to do is: make sure that the mock DB implements the same interface as the real DB. Then everything will be working just fine when being put together.      How to mock DBThere are 2 ways to mock DB.The first one is to implement a fake DB, which stores data in memory. If you followed my gRPC course then you definitely have already known about it.For example, here we have the Store interface that defines a list of actions we can do with the real DB.Then we have a fake DB MemStore struct, which implements all actions of the Store interface, but only uses a map to read and write data.This approach of using fake db is very simple and easy to implement. However, it requires us to write a lot more codes that only be used for testing, which is quite time-consuming for both development and maintenance later.So today I’m gonna show you a better way to mock DB, which is using stubs instead of fake DB.The idea is to use gomock package to generate and build stubs that return hard-coded values for each scenario we want to test.In this example, gomock already generated a MockStore for us. So all we need to do is to call its EXPECT() function to build a stub, which tells gomock that: this GetAccount() function should be called exactly 1 time with this input accountID, and return this account object as output.And that’s it! After setting up the stub, we can simply use this mock store to test the API.Don’t worry if you don’t fully understand it right now. Let’s jump into coding to see how it really works!      Install gomockFirst, we need to install gomock. Let’s open the browser and search for gomock. Then open its Github page.Copy this go get command and run it in the terminal to install the package:❯ go get github.com/golang/mock/mockgen@v1.4.4    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    After this, a mockgen binary file will be available in the go/bin folder.❯ ls -l ~/go/bintotal 341344...-rwxr-xr-x  1 quangpham  staff  10440388 Oct 17 18:27 gotests-rwxr-xr-x  1 quangpham  staff   8914560 Oct 17 18:27 guru-rwxr-xr-x  1 quangpham  staff   5797544 Oct 17 18:27 impl-rwxr-xr-x  1 quangpham  staff   7477056 Nov  2 09:21 mockgen    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We will use this tool to generate the mock db, so it’s important to make sure that it is executable from anywhere. We check that by running:❯ which mockgenmockgen not found    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here it says mockgen not found. That’s because the go/bin folder is not in the PATH environment variable at the moment.To add it to the PATH, I will edit the .zshrc file since I’m using zsh. If you’re using a bash shell then you should edit the .bash_profile or .bashrc file instead.❯ vi ~/.zshrc    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    I'm using vim, so let's press i to enter the insert mode. Then add this export command to the top of the file:export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Press Esc to exit the insert mode, then :wq to save the file and quit vim.Next we have to run this source command to reload the .zshrc file:❯ source ~/.zshrc    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now if we run which mockgen again, we can see that it is now available in the go/bin folder.❯ which mockgen/Users/quangpham/go/bin/mockgen    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Note that the .zshrc file will be automatically loaded when we start a new terminal window. So we don’t need to run the source command every time we open the terminal.      Define Store interfaceAlright, now in order to use mockgen to generate a mock DB, we have to update our code a bit.At the moment, in the api/server.go file, the NewServer() function is accepting a db.Store object:type Server struct {    store  *db.Store    router *gin.Engine}func NewServer(store *db.Store) *Server {    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This db.Store is defined in the db/sqlc/store.go file. It is a struct which will always connect to the real database:type Store struct {    db *sql.DB    *Queries}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    So in order to use a mock DB in the API server tests, we have to replace that store object with an interface. I’m gonna duplicate this Store struct definition and change its type to interface.type Store interface {    // TODO: add functions to this interface}type SQLStore struct {    db *sql.DB    *Queries}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then the old Store struct will be renamed to SQLStore. It will be a real implementation of the Store interface that talks to a SQL database, which is PostgreSQL in this case.Then this NewStore() function should not return a pointer, but just a Store interface. And inside, it should return the real DB implementation of the interface, which is SQLStore.func NewStore(db *sql.DB) Store {    return &amp;SQLStore{        db:      db,        Queries: New(db),    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We also have to change the type of the store receiver of the execTx() function and the TransferTx() function to *SQLStore like this:func (store *SQLStore) execTx(ctx context.Context, fn func(*Queries) error) error {    ...}func (store *SQLStore) TransferTx(ctx context.Context, arg TransferTxParams) (TransferTxResult, error) {}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Alright, now we have to define a list of actions that the Store interface can do.Basically, it should have all functions of the Queries struct, and one more function to execute the transfer money transaction.So first I’m gonna copy this TransferTx() function signature and paste it inside the Store interface:type Store interface {    TransferTx(ctx context.Context, arg TransferTxParams) (TransferTxResult, error)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    For the functions of the Queries struct, of course, we can do the same, like going through all of them and copy-paste one by one. However, it will be too time-consuming because this struct can contain a lot of functions.Lucky for us, the sqlc package that we used to generate CRUD codes also has an option to emit an interface that contains all of the function of the Queries struct.All we have to do is to change this emit_interface setting in the sqlc.yaml file to true:version: \"1\"packages:  - name: \"db\"    path: \"./db/sqlc\"    queries: \"./db/query/\"    schema: \"./db/migration/\"    engine: \"postgresql\"    emit_json_tags: true    emit_prepared_queries: false    emit_interface: true    emit_exact_table_names: false    emit_empty_slices: true    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then run this command in the terminal to regenerate the codes:❯ make sqlc    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    After this, in the db/sqlc folder, we can see a new file called querier.go. It contains the generated Querier interface with all functions to insert and query data from the database:type Querier interface {    AddAccountBalance(ctx context.Context, arg AddAccountBalanceParams) (Account, error)    CreateAccount(ctx context.Context, arg CreateAccountParams) (Account, error)    CreateEntry(ctx context.Context, arg CreateEntryParams) (Entry, error)    CreateTransfer(ctx context.Context, arg CreateTransferParams) (Transfer, error)    DeleteAccount(ctx context.Context, id int64) error    GetAccount(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Account, error)    GetAccountForUpdate(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Account, error)    GetEntry(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Entry, error)    GetTransfer(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Transfer, error)    ListAccounts(ctx context.Context, arg ListAccountsParams) ([]Account, error)    ListEntries(ctx context.Context, arg ListEntriesParams) ([]Entry, error)    ListTransfers(ctx context.Context, arg ListTransfersParams) ([]Transfer, error)    UpdateAccount(ctx context.Context, arg UpdateAccountParams) (Account, error)}var _ Querier = (*Queries)(nil)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    And here you can see it declares a blank variable var _ Querier to make sure that the Queries struct must implement all functions of this Querier interface.Now what we need to do is just embed this Querier inside the Store interface. That would make Store interface to have all of its functions in addition to the TransferTx() function that we’ve added before:type Store interface {    Querier    TransferTx(ctx context.Context, arg TransferTxParams) (TransferTxResult, error)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Next, we have to go back to the api/server.go file and remove this * from *db.Store type because it is no longer a struct pointer, but an interface instead:func NewServer(store db.Store) *Server {    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Note that although we have changed the Store type from struct to interface, our code will still work well, and we don’t have to change anything in the main.go file because the db.NewStore() function is now also returning a Store interface with the actual implementation SQLStore that connects to the real SQL DB.func main() {    config, err := util.LoadConfig(\".\")    if err != nil {        log.Fatal(\"cannot load config:\", err)    }    conn, err := sql.Open(config.DBDriver, config.DBSource)    if err != nil {        log.Fatal(\"cannot connect to db:\", err)    }    store := db.NewStore(conn)    server := api.NewServer(store)    err = server.Start(config.ServerAddress)    if err != nil {        log.Fatal(\"cannot start server:\", err)    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Generate mock DBAlright, so now as we have the db.Store interface, we can use gomock to generate a mock implementation of it.First I will create a new mock folder inside the db package. Then let’s open the terminal and run:❯ mockgen -helpmockgen has two modes of operation: source and reflect.Source mode generates mock interfaces from a source file.It is enabled by using the -source flag. Other flags thatmaybe useful in this mode are -imports and -aux_files.Example:    mockgen -source=foo.go [other options]Reflect mode generates mock interfaces by building a programthat uses reflection to understand interfaces. It is enabledby passing two non-flag arguments: an import path, and acomma-separated list of symbols.Example:    mockgen database/sql/driver Conn,Driver    -aux_files string        (source mode) Comma-separated pkg=path pairs of auxiliary Go source files.    -build_flags string        (reflect mode) Additional flags for go build.    -copyright_file string        Copyright file used to add copyright header    -debug_parser        Print out parser results only.    -destination string        Output file; defaults to stdout.    -exec_only string        (reflect mode) If set, execute this reflection program.    -imports string        (source mode) Comma-separated name=path pairs of explicit imports to use.    -mock_names string        Comma-separated interfaceName=mockName pairs of explicit mock names to use. Mock names default to 'Mock'+ interfaceName suffix.    -package string        Package of the generated code; defaults to the package of the input with a 'mock_' prefix.    -prog_only        (reflect mode) Only generate the reflection program; write it to stdout and exit.    -self_package string        The full package import path for the generated code. The purpose of this flag is to prevent import cycles in the generated code by trying to include its own package. This can happen if the mock's package is set to one of its inputs (usually the main one) and the output is stdio so mockgen cannot detect the final output package. Setting this flag will then tell mockgen which import to exclude.  -source string        (source mode) Input Go source file; enables source mode.  -version        Print version.  -write_package_comment        Writes package documentation comment (godoc) if true. (default true)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Mockgen gives us 2 ways to generate mocks. The source mode will generate mock interfaces from a single source file.Things would be more complicated if this source file imports packages from other files, which is often the case when we work on a real project.In this case, it’s better to use the reflect mode, where we only need to provide the name of the package and the interface, and let mockgen use reflection to automatically figure out what to do.OK so I’m gonna run:❯ mockgen github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc Store    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The first argument is an import path to the Store interface. It's basically the simple bank module name github.com/techschool/simplebank followed by /db/sqlc because our Store interface is defined inside the db/sqlc folder.The second argument we need to pass in this command is the name of the interface, which is Store in this case.We should also specify the destination of the generated output file. Otherwise, mockgen will write the generated codes to stdout by default. So let’s use the -destination option to tell it to write the mock store codes to db/mock/store.go file:❯ mockgen -destination db/mock/store.go github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc Store    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then press enter to run this command.Now get back to visual studio code, we can see that a new file store.go is generated inside the db/mock folder:// Code generated by MockGen. DO NOT EDIT.// Source: github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc (interfaces: Store)// Package mock_sqlc is a generated GoMock package.package mock_sqlcimport (    context \"context\"    gomock \"github.com/golang/mock/gomock\"    db \"github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc\"    reflect \"reflect\")// MockStore is a mock of Store interfacetype MockStore struct {    ctrl     *gomock.Controller    recorder *MockStoreMockRecorder}// MockStoreMockRecorder is the mock recorder for MockStoretype MockStoreMockRecorder struct {    mock *MockStore}// NewMockStore creates a new mock instancefunc NewMockStore(ctrl *gomock.Controller) *MockStore {    mock := &amp;MockStore{ctrl: ctrl}    mock.recorder = &amp;MockStoreMockRecorder{mock}    return mock}// EXPECT returns an object that allows the caller to indicate expected usefunc (m *MockStore) EXPECT() *MockStoreMockRecorder {    return m.recorder}...    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    In this file, there are 2 important struct: MockStore and MockStoreMockRecorder.MockStore is the struct that implements all required functions of the Store interface. For example, here’s the AddAccountBalance() function of the MockStore, which takes a context and an AddAccountBalanceParams as input and returns an Account or an error:// AddAccountBalance mocks base methodfunc (m *MockStore) AddAccountBalance(arg0 context.Context, arg1 db.AddAccountBalanceParams) (db.Account, error) {    m.ctrl.T.Helper()    ret := m.ctrl.Call(m, \"AddAccountBalance\", arg0, arg1)    ret0, _ := ret[0].(db.Account)    ret1, _ := ret[1].(error)    return ret0, ret1}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The MockStoreMockRecorder also has a function with the same name and the same number of arguments. However, the types of these arguments are different. They’re just general interface type:// AddAccountBalance indicates an expected call of AddAccountBalancefunc (mr *MockStoreMockRecorder) AddAccountBalance(arg0, arg1 interface{}) *gomock.Call {    mr.mock.ctrl.T.Helper()    return mr.mock.ctrl.RecordCallWithMethodType(mr.mock, \"AddAccountBalance\", reflect.TypeOf((*MockStore)(nil).AddAccountBalance), arg0, arg1)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Later we will see how this function is used to build stubs. The idea is: we can specify how many times the AddAccountBalance() function should be called, and with what values of the arguments.All other functions of the Store interface are generated in the same manner.Note that the current package name that gomock generated for us is mock_sqlc, which doesn’t look very idiomatic, so I want to change it to something else, such as mockdb.We can instruct mockgen to do that using the -package option. All we have to do is to add -package, followed by mockdb to this command:❯ mockgen -package mockdb -destination db/mock/store.go github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc Store    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then now in the code, the package name has been changed to mockdb as we wanted:// Code generated by MockGen. DO NOT EDIT.// Source: github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc (interfaces: Store)// Package mockdb is a generated GoMock package.package mockdbimport (    context \"context\"    gomock \"github.com/golang/mock/gomock\"    db \"github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc\"    reflect \"reflect\")// MockStore is a mock of Store interfacetype MockStore struct {    ctrl     *gomock.Controller    recorder *MockStoreMockRecorder}// MockStoreMockRecorder is the mock recorder for MockStoretype MockStoreMockRecorder struct {    mock *MockStore}...    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Alright, before start writing API tests using the new generated MockStore, I’m gonna add a new mock command to the Makefile so that we can easily regenerate the code whenever we want....mock:    mockgen -package mockdb -destination db/mock/store.go github.com/techschool/simplebank/db/sqlc Store.PHONY: postgres createdb dropdb migrateup migratedown sqlc test server mock    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now whenever we want to regenerate the mock store, we can simple run make mock in the terminal.      Write unit test for Get Account APIOK, now with the generated MockStore, we can start writing test for our APIs.I’m gonna create a new file account_test.go inside the api package.There are several API to mange bank accounts in our application. But for this lecture, we will only write tests for the most important one: Get Account API. You can easily based on that to write tests for other APIs if you want.In the api/account_test.go file, I will define a new function TestGetAccountAPI() with the testing.T input parameter.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    In order to test this API, we need to have an account first. So let’s write a separate function to generate a random account.It will return a db.Account object, where ID is a random integer between 1 and 1000, Owner is util.RandomOwner(), Balance is util.RandomMoney(), and Currency is util.RandomCurrency().func randomAccount() db.Account {    return db.Account{        ID:       util.RandomInt(1, 1000),        Owner:    util.RandomOwner(),        Balance:  util.RandomMoney(),        Currency: util.RandomCurrency(),    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now go back to the test, we call randomAccount() function to create a new account.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Next we need to create a new mock store using this mockdb.NewMockStore() generated function. It expects a gomock.Controller object as input, so we have to create this controller by calling gomock.NewController and pass in the testing.T object.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)    defer ctrl.Finish()}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We should defer calling Finish method of this controller. This is very important because it will check to see if all methods that were expected to be called were called.We will see how it works in a moment. For now, let’s create a new store by calling mockdb.NewMockStore() with this input controller.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)    defer ctrl.Finish()    store := mockdb.NewMockStore(ctrl)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The next step is to build the stubs for this mock store. In this case, we only care about the GetAccount() method, since it’s the only method that should be called by the Get Account API handler.So let’s build stub for this method by calling store.EXPECT().GetAccount(). This function expects 2 input arguments of type general interface.Why 2 input arguments? That’s because the GetAccount() method of our Store interface requires 2 input parameters: a context and an account ID.type Querier interface {    GetAccount(ctx context.Context, id int64) (Account, error)    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Thus for this stub definition, we have to specify what values of these 2 parameters we expect this function to be called with.The first context argument could be any value, so we use gomock.Any() matcher for it. The second argument should equal to the ID of the random account we created above. So we use this matcher: gomock.Eq() and pass the account.ID to it.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)    defer ctrl.Finish()    store := mockdb.NewMockStore(ctrl)    store.EXPECT().        GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Eq(account.ID)).        Times(1).        Return(account, nil)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now this stub definition can be translated as: I expect the GetAccount() function of the store to be called with any context and this specific account ID arguments.We can also specify how many times this function should be called using the Times() function. Here Times(1) means we expect this function to be called exactly 1 time.More than that, we can use the Return() function to tell gomock to return some specific values whenever the GetAccount() function is called. For example, in this case, we want it to return the account object and a nil error.Note that the input arguments of this Return() function should match with the return values of the GetAccount function as defined in the Querier interface.Alright, now the stub for our mock Store is built. We can use it to start the test HTTP server and send GetAccount request. Let’s create a server by calling NewServer() function with the mock store.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    ...    server := NewServer(store)    recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    For testing an HTTP API in Go, we don’t have to start a real HTTP server. Instead, we can just use the recording feature of the httptest package to record the response of the API request. So here we call httptest.NewRecorder() to create a new ResponseRecorder.Next we will declare the url path of the API we want to call, which should be /accounts/{ID of the account we want to get}.Then we create a new HTTP Request with method GET to that URL. And since it’s a GET request, we can use nil for the request body.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    ...    server := NewServer(store)    recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()    url := fmt.Sprintf(\"/accounts/%d\", tc.accountID)    request, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, url, nil)    require.NoError(t, err)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This http.NewRequest function will return a request object or an error. We require no errors to be returned.Then we call server.router.ServeHTTP() function with the created recorder and request objects.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)    defer ctrl.Finish()    store := mockdb.NewMockStore(ctrl)    store.EXPECT().        GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Eq(account.ID)).        Times(1).        Return(account, nil)    server := NewServer(store)    recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()    url := fmt.Sprintf(\"/accounts/%d\", tc.accountID)    request, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, url, nil)    require.NoError(t, err)    server.router.ServeHTTP(recorder, request)    require.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, recorder.Code)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Basically, this will send our API request through the server router and record its response in the recorder. All we need to do is to check that response.The simplest thing we can check is the HTTP status code. In the happy case, it should be http.StatusOK. This status code is recorded in the Code field of the recorder.And that’s it! Let’s run the test.It passed. Awesome!Now I’m gonna show you what will happen if in the getAccount() handler function of api/account.go file we don’t call the store.GetAccount function. Let’s comment out this block of code and just set account to be an empty object.func (server *Server) getAccount(ctx *gin.Context) {    var req getAccountRequest    if err := ctx.ShouldBindUri(&amp;req); err != nil {        ctx.JSON(http.StatusBadRequest, errorResponse(err))        return    }    // account, err := server.store.GetAccount(ctx, req.ID)    // if err != nil {    //     if err == sql.ErrNoRows {    //         ctx.JSON(http.StatusNotFound, errorResponse(err))    //         return    //     }    //     ctx.JSON(http.StatusInternalServerError, errorResponse(err))    //     return    // }    account := db.Account{}    ctx.JSON(http.StatusOK, account)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Save this file and rerun the unit test.This time, the test failed. And the reason is due to a missing call to the store.GetAccount function. We expect that function to be called exactly once, but in the implementation, it’s not getting called.So now you know one power of the gomock package. It makes writing unit tests so easy and saves us tons of time implementing the mock interface.Now, what if we want to check more than just the HTTP status code? To make the test more robust, we should check the response body as well.The response body is stored in the recorder.Body field, which is in fact just a bytes.Buffer pointer.We expect it to match the account that we generated at the top of the test. So I’m gonna write a new function: requireBodyMatchAccount() for this purpose.It will have 3 input arguments: the testing.T, the response body of type byte.Buffer pointer, and the account object to compare.func requireBodyMatchAccount(t *testing.T, body *bytes.Buffer, account db.Account) {    data, err := ioutil.ReadAll(body)    require.NoError(t, err)    var gotAccount db.Account    err = json.Unmarshal(data, &amp;gotAccount)    require.NoError(t, err)    require.Equal(t, account, gotAccount)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    First we call ioutil.ReadAll() to read all data from the response body and store it in a data variable. We require no errors to be returned.Then we declare a new gotAccount variable to store the account object we got from the response body data.Then we call json.Unmarshal to unmarshal the data to the gotAccount object. Require no errors, then require the gotAccount to be equal to the input account.And we’re done. Now let’s go back to the unit test and call requireBodyMatchAccount function with the testing.T, the recorder.Body, and the generated account as input arguments.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)    defer ctrl.Finish()    store := mockdb.NewMockStore(ctrl)    store.EXPECT().        GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Eq(account.ID)).        Times(1).        Return(account, nil)    server := NewServer(store)    recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()    url := fmt.Sprintf(\"/accounts/%d\", tc.accountID)    request, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, url, nil)    require.NoError(t, err)    server.router.ServeHTTP(recorder, request)    require.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, recorder.Code)    requireBodyMatchAccount(t, recorder.Body, account)}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then rerun the test.It passed. Excellent!OK, so the GetAccount API unit test is working very well. But it only covers the happy case for now.Next, I’m gonna show you how to transform this test into a table-driven test set to cover all possible scenarios of the GetAccount API and to get 100% coverage.      Achieve 100% coverageFirst, we need to declare a list of test cases. I’m gonna use an anonymous class to store the test data.Each test case will have a unique name to separate it from others. Then there should be an account ID that we want to get.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    testCases := []struct {        name          string        accountID     int64        buildStubs    func(store *mockdb.MockStore)        checkResponse func(t *testing.T, recoder *httptest.ResponseRecorder)    }{        // TODO: add test data    }    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Moreover, the GetAccount stub for each scenario will be built differently, so here I have a buildStubs field, which is actually a function that takes a mock store as input. We can use this mock store to build the stub that suits the purpose of each test case.Similarly, we have a checkResponse function to check the output of the API. It has 2 input arguments: a testing.T, and a httptest.ResponseRecorder object.Now with this struct definition, let’s add the first scenario for the happy case.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    testCases := []struct {        name          string        accountID     int64        buildStubs    func(store *mockdb.MockStore)        checkResponse func(t *testing.T, recoder *httptest.ResponseRecorder)    }{        {            name:      \"OK\",            accountID: account.ID,            buildStubs: func(store *mockdb.MockStore) {                store.EXPECT().                    GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Eq(account.ID)).                    Times(1).                    Return(account, nil)            },            checkResponse: func(t *testing.T, recorder *httptest.ResponseRecorder) {                require.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, recorder.Code)                requireBodyMatchAccount(t, recorder.Body, account)            },        },    }    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Its name is \"OK\". The account ID should be account.ID. Next, for the buildStubs function, I’m gonna copy its signature here. Then move the store.EXPECT command into this function.Similar for the checkResponse function. Let’s copy its signature. Then move the 2 require commands into it.We will add more cases to this list later. For now, let’s refactor the code a bit to make it work for multiple scenarios.We use a simple for loop to iterate through the list of test cases. Then inside the loop, we declare new tc variable to store the data of current test case.We gonna run each case as a separate sub-test of this unit test, so let’s call t.Run() function, pass in the name of this test case, and a function that takes testing.T object as input. Then I’m gonna move all of these statements into that function.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    ...    for i := range testCases {        tc := testCases[i]        t.Run(tc.name, func(t *testing.T) {            ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)            defer ctrl.Finish()            store := mockdb.NewMockStore(ctrl)            tc.buildStubs(store)            server := NewServer(store)            recorder := httptest.NewRecorder()            url := fmt.Sprintf(\"/accounts/%d\", tc.accountID)            request, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, url, nil)            require.NoError(t, err)            server.router.ServeHTTP(recorder, request)            tc.checkResponse(t, recorder)        })    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Note that the url should be created with the tc.accountID so that it will use the account ID defined for each test case.We call tc.buildStubs() function with the mock store before sending the request, and finally call tc.checkResponse() function at the end to verify the result.OK, let’s rerun the test to make sure our happy case still works.Yee, it passed! So now it’s time to add more cases.I’m gonna duplicate the happy case's test data. The second case we want to test is when the account is not found. So its name should be \"NotFound\".We can use the same accountID here because mock store is separated for each test case. But we need to change our buildStubs function a bit.func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    testCases := []struct {        name          string        accountID     int64        buildStubs    func(store *mockdb.MockStore)        checkResponse func(t *testing.T, recoder *httptest.ResponseRecorder)    }{        {            name:      \"OK\",            accountID: account.ID,            buildStubs: func(store *mockdb.MockStore) {                store.EXPECT().                    GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Eq(account.ID)).                    Times(1).                    Return(account, nil)            },            checkResponse: func(t *testing.T, recorder *httptest.ResponseRecorder) {                require.Equal(t, http.StatusOK, recorder.Code)                requireBodyMatchAccount(t, recorder.Body, account)            },        },        {            name:      \"NotFound\",            accountID: account.ID,            buildStubs: func(store *mockdb.MockStore) {                store.EXPECT().                    GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Eq(account.ID)).                    Times(1).                    Return(db.Account{}, sql.ErrNoRows)            },            checkResponse: func(t *testing.T, recorder *httptest.ResponseRecorder) {                require.Equal(t, http.StatusNotFound, recorder.Code)            },        },    }    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here instead of returning this specific account, we should return an empty Account{} object together with a sql.ErrNoRows error. That’s because in the real implementation of the Store that connects to Postgres, the db/sql package will return this error if no account is found when executing the SELECT query.We also have to change the checkResponse function, because in this case, we expect the server to return http.StatusNotFound instead. And since the account is not found, we can remove the requireBodyMatchAccount call.Alright, let’s run the test again.Cool! Both tests passed.Let’s run the whole package test to see the code coverge.In the account.go file, we can see that this getAccount handler is not 100% covered.Right now only the not found case and the successful case are covered. We still have to test 2 more cases: InternalServerError and BadRequest.Once again, I’m gonna duplicate the test data, change its name to \"InternalError\".func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    testCases := []struct {        name          string        accountID     int64        buildStubs    func(store *mockdb.MockStore)        checkResponse func(t *testing.T, recoder *httptest.ResponseRecorder)    }{        ...        {            name:      \"InternalError\",            accountID: account.ID,            buildStubs: func(store *mockdb.MockStore) {                store.EXPECT().                    GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Eq(account.ID)).                    Times(1).                    Return(db.Account{}, sql.ErrConnDone)            },            checkResponse: func(t *testing.T, recorder *httptest.ResponseRecorder) {                require.Equal(t, http.StatusInternalServerError, recorder.Code)            },        },    }    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now in the buildStubs function, instead of returning sql.ErrNoRows, I return sql.ErrConnDone, which basically is one possible error that the db/sql package can return when a query is run on a connection that has already been returned to the connection pool.In this case, it should be considered an internal error, so in the checkResponse function, we must require the recorder.Code to be equal to http.StatusInternalServerError.Let’s rerun the package test.All passed. And we can now see that the InternalServerError branch in the code is now covered.The last scenario we should test is BadRequest, which means the client has sent some invalid parameters to this API.To reproduce this scenario, we will use an invalid account ID that doesn’t satisfy this binding condition.So I’m gonna go back to the test file, duplicate this test data one more time, change its name to InvalidID, and update this accountID to 0, which is an invalid value because the minimum ID should be 1.In this case, we should change the second parameter of the GetAccount function call to gomock.Any().func TestGetAccountAPI(t *testing.T) {    account := randomAccount()    testCases := []struct {        name          string        accountID     int64        buildStubs    func(store *mockdb.MockStore)        checkResponse func(t *testing.T, recoder *httptest.ResponseRecorder)    }{        ...        {            name:      \"InvalidID\",            accountID: 0,            buildStubs: func(store *mockdb.MockStore) {                store.EXPECT().                    GetAccount(gomock.Any(), gomock.Any()).                    Times(0)            },            checkResponse: func(t *testing.T, recorder *httptest.ResponseRecorder) {                require.Equal(t, http.StatusBadRequest, recorder.Code)            },        },    }    ...}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    And since the ID is invalid, the GetAccount function should not be called by the handler. Therefore, we must update this to Times(0), and remove the Return function call.For the checkResponse, we must change the status code to http.StatusBadRequest.And that’s all. Let’s rerun the whole package tests!All passed. Great! And looking at the code of the getAccount handler, we can see that it is 100% covered. So our goal is achieved!However, the test log is currently containing too much information.There are many duplicate debug logs written by Gin, which make it harder to read the test result.The reason is that Gin is running in Debug mode by default. So let’s create a new main_test.go file inside the api package and config Gin to use Test mode instead.The content of this file will be very similar to that of the main_test.go file in the db package, so I’m gonna copy this TestMain function, and paste it to our new file. Then let’s delete all statements of this function, except for the last one.Now all we need to do is to call gin.SetMode to change it to gin.TestModefunc TestMain(m *testing.M) {    gin.SetMode(gin.TestMode)    os.Exit(m.Run())}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    And that’s it! We’re done. Now let’s go back to our test file and run the whole package tests.All passed. And now the logs look much cleaner and easier to read than before.      ConclusionOK, so today we have learned how to use gomock to generate mocks for our DB interface, and use it to write unit tests for the Get Account API to achieve 100% coverage. It really helps us write tests faster, easier, cleaner, safer, and much more robust.You can apply this knowledge to write tests for other HTTP APIs in our simple bank project such as Create Account or Delete Account API.I will push the code to Github so that you can have a reference in case you want to take a look.Thanks a lot for reading and see you soon in the next lecture.If you like the article, please subscribe to our Youtube channel and follow us on Twitter or Facebook for more tutorials in the future.<\/details> | <p style=\"display:none\">2020-11-14 13:39:41<\/p>Sat 11/14 | <a href=\"https://dev.to\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >DEV Community<\/a>","<p style=\"display:none\">2020-11-14 12:52:02<\/p><a href=\"https://dev.to/aws-builders/new-mac-config-f38\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >New Mac Config<\/a><details><summary>My previous Mac was starting to overheat so it was swapped for another.

It allows us to analyze our website's performance and figure out ways we can improve it.The problem with SPAs (Single-Page Applications) is that they show content after loading JavaScript chunks first, so it takes a little while on the client before it can actually render content and that can destroy PageSpeed Insights score.Our app has to be an SSR (Server-Side Rendered) app. We are using React for this project, but really you can use any framework you like, the same concepts apply. This is a framework-agnostic article. It works with:You can go about this in a lot of different ways. You can use:React and Express (which I'm using)Next.js for ReactNuxt.js for VueSapper for SvelteAngular UniversalGatsbyJAM Stack...etcHere's is the final architecture we'll be using:Score before optimization (Mobile)Score before optimization (Desktop)We notice there are some major problems that PageSpeed Insights has uncovered for us right out of the box.      Remove unused JavaScriptThis can be a tough task for SPAs and a general problem in all frameworks, however, I will only be talking about React, but the same concepts apply in all frameworks.      BundlephobiaBundlephobia is a great tool for analyzing bundle sizes of packages you install with NPM.Moment.jsmoment is a huge library with a large bundle size compared to its alternative dayjsDay.js      Lazy load componentsSince we're using Express and React, we can use react-universal-component to split the app into chunks and lazy-load them accordingly.But really, you can use any framework or any library you want!      Reduce initial server response time (TTFB)We'll start with the easy one. High TTFB (Time-To-First-Byte) could be caused by a lot of different factors:Server resources are lowStatic pages are not cachedThe first problem is obvious, we just need to upgrade the server to handle more traffic, but before we do that, let's make sure our pages are properly cached first!You can use any method you like when caching static pages, you can cache using a CDN like Cloudflare or AWS Cloudfront.If your website's cache policy depends on custom parameters, you can implement your own caching layer above the SSR middleware in React.Here at CoatConnect, we cache based on different parameters, for example:User's languageCurrency based on the user's locationDevice type (mobile, tablet, or desktop)Add cache key generator middlewareThis middleware generates a unique cache key for each different version of the website. It looks different on mobile than it does on desktop and it has different data for users based in the USA than people in the Middle East for example.const cacheMiddleware = async (req, res, next) =&gt; {  const key = `${req.url}${req.currency}${req.initialLanguage}${req.deviceType}`;  const cacheKey = md5(key);  req.cacheKey = cacheKey;  ...});    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We can later use this cache key to store the resulting HTML in memory or in files. We can use node-cache for that.const cacheHolder = new NodeCache({ stdTTL: 3600, checkperiod: 600, useClones: false });const cacheHTML = (key, html) =&gt; {  cacheHolder.set(key, html);};    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We can call this cacheHTML method, and pass it the cacheKey and rendered HTML. We can also store different cache keys under the same request path to be able to invalidate the cache whenever the data changes.      Defer offscreen imagesWhen you open a website that has img tags in it, the browser goes ahead and fetches all these images and the document will be loaded when all the images are downloaded.Most of the time we have images that the user does not see until they scroll down the page. Those images must be lazy-loaded to avoid big load times on websites. For that, we will use react-lazy-load-image-component.This component is very easy to use, you just use it like you would use a normal img tag:import React from 'react';import { LazyLoadImage } from 'react-lazy-load-image-component';const MyImage = ({ image }) =&gt; (  &lt;div&gt;    &lt;LazyLoadImage      alt={image.alt}      height={image.height}      src={image.src} // use normal &lt;img&gt; attributes as props      width={image.width} /&gt;    &lt;span&gt;{image.caption}&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;);export default MyImage;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Minimize main thread workFiguring out what's blocking the main thread can be a tough task, but here are common problems:Whole page is hydrated while loadingThird-party scripts are not deferredOne of the ways to optimize blocking time is to lazy hydrate the page, and for that we will use react-lazy-hydration.SSR OnlyThis option should be used with static content that never changes on the page with JavaScript because, ssrOnly skips hydration all-together.import React from \"react\";import LazyHydrate from \"react-lazy-hydration\";function App() {  return (    &lt;div&gt;      &lt;LazyHydrate ssrOnly&gt;        {...}      &lt;/LazyHydrate&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  );}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    When IdlePlease keep in mind that this step is very important for the LCP too. LCP is calculated after the dom has stopped shifting and changing, so instantly hydrating the part the user sees on the screen first is very important to avoid big LCP time.&lt;LazyHydrate whenIdle&gt;  {...}&lt;/LazyHydrate&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    When VisibleYou have to mark every part on the page that the user does not see instantly as whenVisible to avoid blocking the DOM while hydrating these parts.One of the reasons we had issues at CoatConnect is that we had Google Maps on some of our pages and the Google Maps scripts were loaded and executed alongside our code while the page was being hydrated which destroyed our blocking time, so it is very important to use whenVisible with the parts on the page that the user does not see instantly.&lt;LazyHydrate whenVisible&gt;  {...}&lt;/LazyHydrate&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Make sure every third-party script added and all JavaScript chunks are deferred.&lt;script src=\"[some-third-party-script].js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;script src=\"[some-chunk].[hash].js\" defer&gt;&lt;/script&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Avoid redirects at all costsRedirects cause a delay in page load and whatever that delay maybe every millisecond matters! If a delay in page redirect is 300ms, that's 300ms you could save on page load time.If you are using a URL shortener for assets especially images, that's a 300ms delay on each image and sometimes that image could be your LCP      Load CSS asynchronouslyCSS is a pretty expensive asset that can block the main UI thread. To prevent CSS from blocking the main UI thread we have to do two things:Load CSS asynchronouslyGenerate our critical path CSSYou can load CSS asynchronously using JavaScript like this:&lt;link href=\"CSS_ASSET\" rel=\"stylesheet\" media=\"print\" onload=\"this.media='all';this.onload=null;\" /&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Adding this onload=\"this.media='all';this.onload=null;\" will cause CSS to load asynchronously preventing it from blocking the main thread, but doing that would make our website with no styles at all until the CSS loads and cause CLS and delay of LCP.      Critical Path CSSTo optimize for a high LCP score, we have to show styled content on the screen as fast as possible and not wait for external CSS or for JavaScript to edit the DOM.Here's the content we want to show to the user eventually:JavaScript EnabledPreviously, we made CSS load asynchronously using JavaScript. Now, let's try disabling your JavaScript.Open the Inspector (Ctrl+Shift+I)Hit Ctrl+PType in &gt; Disable JavaScriptJavaScript Disabled (No CSS)Since we load CSS using JavaScript, CSS is not loaded, and as you can see, the page does not have any styles at all!To fix that, we need to generate the Critical Path CSS (CCSS). It is basically the CSS needed to only render what the user sees on the screen first.JavaScript disabled (CCSS)You can see here that the page has the critical CSS on it without the need of downloading the full CSS stylesheet or JavaScript. As a matter of fact, there are images that are not shown here because they are lazy-loaded and JavaScript is not enabled.To generate CCSS, you can use the npm package critical.// eslint-disable-next-line prefer-constlet { html, uncritical } = await critical.generate({  base: 'build/public', // Local path to public assets  html: renderedHTML, // Result of Server-Side rendered code  width: viewPort.width, // User's device view port  height: viewPort.height, // User's device view port  inline: true, // Inlines css to improve performance  minify: true, // Minifies css put into the &lt;style&gt; tag in the head  rebase: asset =&gt; ..., // Post process paths to assets in your css e.g. images, fonts, ...etc});    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Getting the viewport of the userWe can use the User-Agent header to detect which type of device the user is using and we can use the npm package mobile-detect for that.import MobileDetect from 'mobile-detect';export const getDeviceType = req =&gt; {  const md = new MobileDetect(req.headers['user-agent']);  if (md.tablet()) {    return 'tablet';  }  if (md.mobile()) {    return 'mobile';  }  return 'desktop';};    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We can then use this express middleware to inject viewPort property in the request.const deviceTypeMiddleware = (req, res, next) =&gt; {  req.deviceType = getDeviceType(req);  req.viewPort = {    mobile: { width: 414, height: 896 },    tablet: { width: 768, height: 1024 },    desktop: { width: 1366, height: 842 },  }[req.deviceType];  next();};    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Width and height for mobile, tablet, and desktop are referenced online from this article and personal experience.This critical path CSS generator does not require you to use express for server-side rendering your app. It can sit in the middle between your server and your clients and act as a cache layer.The article was originally published on my blog here.Feel free to follow me on Twitter.

It is open source and free to use.Linux is powering 30% of all websites globally. It is open source and free to use.These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.According to the State of the Octoverse report by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new users joined in 2019 alone!The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.Do you feel the same way?Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now.      You can learn a lot from the source codeSince the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run.      You will work with the smartest peopleCompared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.A good example is the well-known code editor Visual Studio Code which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer.      Your own code could be used globallySince some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called eslint-plugin-unicorn and svelte. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment.      Open source projects are inclusiveA great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project.      Projects are starting to become sustainableThe main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.With websites like OpenCollective or GitHub Sponsors, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time.      How to contribute to open sourceContributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.Don’t know where to start?Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.The README.md file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time!      Wrapping upIt always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.

This style is usually associated with RPC (Remote Procedure Calls).The acronym POX stand for Plain Old XML, this is because XML was used primarily as the payload of the request/response of the RPC however this idea can really be extended to any other formats, we will be using JSON for the examples.Lets assume we have a social media app that lets users follow other users. Before following any specific user, we first want to show a list of all users. The app in this case will expose services at two separate endpoints.An endpoint for listing of all usersAn endpoint for following other usersFirst we will initiate a request to the first endpoint to list all users from Canada #Request POST /listUsers HTTP/1.1 {  \"country\" : \"Canada\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    After the service receives the request, it will retrieve a list of all users living in Canada #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  [    { \"name\" : \"John Smith\", \"id\" : 45 },    { \"name\" : \"Jane Doe\", \"id\" : 22 }  ] }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The next step now is to call the endpoint for following the desired user #Request POST /followUser HTTP/1.1 {  \"id\" : 22 }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    the response could be either a success or an error, in case of success it will look something like this: #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  \"status\" : \"success\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    in case of an error it will look something like this: #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  \"status\" : \"error\",  \"message\" : \"already following\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Notice that the request HTTP Method is always POST and the service HTTP status code is always 200 regardless of the state of the process.      Level 1 - ResourcesIn this level, the service starts working with resources denoted in the URI of the request. Note that resource identification is part of one of the main REST constraints which is having a  Uniform InterfaceThe first request will be to the /users endpoint to get the list of all users, the response will be similar to the one before #Request POST /users HTTP/1.1 {  \"country\" : \"Canada\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode     #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  [    { \"name\" : \"John Smith\", \"id\" : 45 },    { \"name\" : \"Jane Doe\", \"id\" : 22 }  ] }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now following the desired user by his id #Request POST /users/22 HTTP/1.1 {}       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The response could be either a success or an error #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  \"status\" : \"success\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode     #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  \"status\" : \"error\",  \"message\" : \"already following\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Notice that the HTTP Method as well as the HTTP status code remain unchanged just like Level 0 (POST and 200)      Level 3 - HTTP VerbsUp until now, we have been strictly using HTTP POST, the idea was using HTTP only to tunnel the interactions through it and not utilizing any of its web mechanisms ( i.e:  verbs and status codes ).In this level we make sure to be as close as possible to the intent of the request in regards to the HTTP VerbsThe first request is now GET request to /users since we are logically reading or getting data, if we need to filter out based on a specific country we can now utilize query parameters #Request GET /users?country=canada HTTP/1.1     Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The response will be a list of users from Canada just like Level 0 and 1 #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  [    { \"name\" : \"John Smith\", \"id\" : 45 },    { \"name\" : \"Jane Doe\", \"id\" : 22 }  ] }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now when following another user we use POST, you can think of it as if we are logically creating a new follow request #Request POST /users/22 HTTP/1.1 {}       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The response could be either a success or an error, in the case of success, it is denoted by the corresponding HTTP status code #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK { }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    In case of an error, a proper HTTP status code can be utilized as well #Response HTTP/1.1 409 CONFLICT {  \"message\" : \"already following\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Level 3 - Hypermedia controlsLevel 3 introduces using something you might have heard about here or there which is HATEOAS ( Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State ). Essentially HATEOAS makes the API respond to requests with additional information and resource links that make exploring the API and accessing additional resources easier. Most of the time it can infer to the client as to what \"actions\" can be done next and where to access them if needed.As before the request to get all users #Request GET /users?country=canada HTTP/1.1     Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now we have the API respond with relevant hypermedia controls #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK {  [    {       \"name\" : \"John Smith\",       \"id\" : 45 ,        \"links\" : [       {         \"rel\" : \"rels/user/follow\",         \"href\" : \"/users/45\",       }      ]    },    {       \"name\" : \"Jane Doe\",       \"id\" : 22,        \"links\" : [       {         \"rel\" : \"rels/user/follow\",         \"href\" : \"/users/22\",       }      ]    },  ] }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The rest of the requests/responses are pretty much the same as the previous level #Request POST /users/22 HTTP/1.1 {}       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    success/failure #Response HTTP/1.1 200 OK { }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode     #Response HTTP/1.1 409 CONFLICT {  \"message\" : \"already following\" }       Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    For many engineers, Level 2 seems to be enough and will put the API in a very solid state. You can imagine the complexity HATEOAS would introduce at both ends of the stack. However it has some  benefits that shouldn't be just ignored.HATEOAS provides the ability to seamlessly update the URI Schema of the APIs without worrying about or breaking clients as well as providing a self documenting API.      Closing ThoughtsOverall i think RMM in itself is not a model that defines how a truly RESTful API should look like, but it provides good guidelines that if followed can lead to a solid API Design head start. Personally, i believe Level 3 is not worth the added complexity unless used in a very niche case where having a discoverable API is one of the key requirements of the project at hand.I think introducing RMM especially to beginners in backend engineering is very important since it can make them think about good API Design and generally what makes an API RESTful by forcing them to atleast think about some of the constraints of REST even though it doesn't define it.<\/details> | <p style=\"display:none\">2020-11-14 11:56:35<\/p>Sat 11/14 | <a href=\"https://dev.to\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >DEV Community<\/a>","<p style=\"display:none\">2020-11-14 11:49:29<\/p><a href=\"https://dev.to/bhuma08/deploy-your-react-app-using-netlify-4fp7\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >Deploy your React app using Netlify<\/a><details><summary>Now that you have built your very first web application using React, it's time to deploy it.

Before Python2.6, to format a string, one would either use the % operator, or string.Template module. Some time later, the str.format method came along and added to the language a more flexible and robust way of formatting a string.Old string formatting with %:&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = 'hello world'&gt;&gt;&gt; 'msg: %s' % msg'msg: hello world'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Using string.format:&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = 'hello world'&gt;&gt;&gt; 'msg: {}'.format(msg)'msg: hello world'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    To simplify formatting even further, in 2015, Eric Smith proposed the PEP 498 -- Literal String Interpolation.PEP 498 presented this new string interpolation to be a simple and easy to use alternative to str.format. The only thing required was one more char - f\"\" - at the beginning of the string.Using f-strings:&gt;&gt;&gt; msg = 'hello world'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'msg: {msg}''msg: hello world'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    And that was it! No need to use str.format or %. However, f-strings don’t replace str.format completely. In this guide I’ll show you an example where they are not suitable.      Basic String Formatting With PythonAs I have shown in the previous section, formatting a string using f-strings is quite straightforward. The sole requirement is to provide it a valid expression. f-strings can also start with capital F and you can combine with raw strings. However, you cannot mix them with bytes b\"\" or \"u\".&gt;&gt;&gt; book = \"The dog guide\"&gt;&gt;&gt; num_pages = 124&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"The book {book} has {num_pages} pages\"'The book The dog guide has 124 pages'&gt;&gt;&gt; F\"The book {book} has {num_pages} pages\"'The book The dog guide has 124 pages'&gt;&gt;&gt; print(Fr\"The book {book} has {num_pages} pages\\n\")The book The dog guide has 124 pages\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(FR\"The book {book} has {num_pages} pages\\n\")The book The dog guide has 124 pages\\n&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f\"The book {book} has {num_pages} pages\\n\")The book The dog guide has 124 pages    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    And that's pretty much it! In the next section, I'll show you several examples of everything you can do - and cannot do - with f-strings.      LimitationsEven though f-strings are very convenient, they don't replace str.format completely. f-strings evaluate expressions in the context where they appear. According the the  PEP 498, this means the expression has full access to local and global variables. They're also an expression evaluated at runtime. If the expression used inside the { &lt;expr&gt; } cannot be evaluated, the interpreter will raise an exception.&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{name}\"---------------------------------------------------------------------------NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)&lt;ipython-input-1-f0acc441190f&gt; in &lt;module&gt;----&gt; 1 f\"{name}\"NameError: name 'name' is not defined    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This is not a problem for the str.format method, as you can define the template string and then call .format to pass on the context.&gt;&gt;&gt; s = \"{name}\"&gt;&gt;&gt; s.format(name=\"Python\")'Python'&gt;&gt;&gt; print(s){name}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Another limitation is that you cannot use inline comments inside a f-string.&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"My name is {name #name}!\"  File \"&lt;ipython-input-37-0ae1738dd871&gt;\", line 1    f\"My name is {name #name}!\"    ^SyntaxError: f-string expression part cannot include '#'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Format an ExpressionIf you don't want to define variables, you can use literals inside the brackets. Python will evaluate the expression and display the final result.&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"4 * 4 is {4 * 4}\"'4 * 4 is 16'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Or if you prefer...&gt;&gt;&gt; n = 4&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"4 * 4 is {n * n}\"'4 * 4 is 16'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Use F-Strings to Debug Your CodeOne of most frequent usages of f-string is debugging. Before Python 3.8, many people would do hello = 42; f\"hello = {hello}\", but this is very repetitive. As a result, Python 3.8 brought a new feature. You can re-write that expression as f\"{hello=}\" and Python will display hello=42. The following example illustrates this using a function, but the principle is the same.&gt;&gt;&gt; def magic_number():     ...:     return 42     ...: &gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{magic_number() = }\"'magic_number() = 42'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Format Integers in Different Basesf-strings also allow you to display an integer in different bases. For example, you can display an int as binary without converting it by using the b option.&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{7:b}''111'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    In summary, you can use f-strings to format: int to binaryint to hexint to octalint to HEX (where all chars are capitalized)The following example uses the padding feature and the base formatting to create a table that displays an int in other bases.&gt;&gt;&gt; bases = {       \"b\": \"bin\",        \"o\": \"oct\",        \"x\": \"hex\",        \"X\": \"HEX\",        \"d\": \"decimal\"}&gt;&gt;&gt; for n in range(1, 21):     ...:     for base, desc in bases.items():     ...:         print(f\"{n:5{base}}\", end=' ')     ...:     print()    1     1     1     1     1    10     2     2     2     2    11     3     3     3     3   100     4     4     4     4   101     5     5     5     5   110     6     6     6     6   111     7     7     7     7  1000    10     8     8     8  1001    11     9     9     9  1010    12     a     A    10  1011    13     b     B    11  1100    14     c     C    12  1101    15     d     D    13  1110    16     e     E    14  1111    17     f     F    15 10000    20    10    10    16 10001    21    11    11    17 10010    22    12    12    18 10011    23    13    13    19 10100    24    14    14    20    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Print Objects With F-StringsYou can print custom objects using f-strings. By default, when you pass an object instance to a f-string, it will display what the __str__ method returns. However, you can also use the explicit conversion flag to display the __repr__.!r - converts the value to a string using repr().!s - converts the value to a string using str().    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    &gt;&gt;&gt; class Color:    def __init__(self, r: float = 255, g: float = 255, b: float = 255):        self.r = r        self.g = g        self.b = b    def __str__(self) -&gt; str:        return \"A RGB color\"    def __repr__(self) -&gt; str:        return f\"Color(r={self.r}, g={self.g}, b={self.b})\"&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Color(r=123, g=32, b=255)# When no option is passed, the __str__ result is printed&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{c}\"'A RGB color'# When `obj!r` is used, the __repr__ output is printed&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{c!r}\"'Color(r=123, g=32, b=255)'# Same as the default&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{c!s}\"'A RGB color'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Python also allows us to control the formatting on a per-type basis  through the __format__ method. The following example shows how you can do all of that.&gt;&gt;&gt; class Color:    def __init__(self, r: float = 255, g: float = 255, b: float = 255):        self.r = r        self.g = g        self.b = b    def __str__(self) -&gt; str:        return \"A RGB color\"    def __repr__(self) -&gt; str:        return f\"Color(r={self.r}, g={self.g}, b={self.b})\"    def __format__(self, format_spec: str) -&gt; str:        if not format_spec or format_spec == \"s\":            return str(self)        if format_spec == \"r\":            return repr(self)        if format_spec == \"v\":            return f\"Color(r={self.r}, g={self.g}, b={self.b}) - A nice RGB thing.\"        if format_spec == \"vv\":            return (                f\"Color(r={self.r}, g={self.g}, b={self.b}) \"                f\"- A more verbose nice RGB thing.\"            )        if format_spec == \"vvv\":            return (                f\"Color(r={self.r}, g={self.g}, b={self.b}) \"                f\"- A SUPER verbose nice RGB thing.\"            )        raise ValueError(            f\"Unknown format code '{format_spec}' \" \"for object of type 'Color'\"        )&gt;&gt;&gt; c = Color(r=123, g=32, b=255)&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{c:v}''Color(r=123, g=32, b=255) - A nice RGB thing.'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{c:vv}''Color(r=123, g=32, b=255) - A more verbose nice RGB thing.'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{c:vvv}''Color(r=123, g=32, b=255) - A SUPER verbose nice RGB thing.'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{c}''A RGB color'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{c:s}''A RGB color'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{c:r}''Color(r=123, g=32, b=255)'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{c:j}'---------------------------------------------------------------------------ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)&lt;ipython-input-20-1c0ee8dd74be&gt; in &lt;module&gt;----&gt; 1 f'{c:j}'&lt;ipython-input-15-985c4992e957&gt; in __format__(self, format_spec)     29                 f\"- A SUPER verbose nice RGB thing.\"     30             )---&gt; 31         raise ValueError(     32             f\"Unknown format code '{format_spec}' \" \"for object of type 'Color'\"     33         )ValueError: Unknown format code 'j' for object of type 'Color'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Lastly, there's also the a option that escapes non-ASCII chars.

To do that, you can add a : (colon) followed by a . (dot) and the number of decimal places with a f suffix. For instance, you can round a float to 2 decimal places and print the variable just like this:&gt;&gt;&gt; num = 4.123956&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"num rounded to 2 decimal palces = {num:.2f}\"'num rounded to 2 decimal palces = 4.12'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If you don't specify anything, the float variable will use the full precision.&gt;&gt;&gt; print(f'{num}')4.123956    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Format a Number as PercentagePython f-strings have a very convenient way of formatting percentage. The rules are similar to float formatting, except that you append a % instead of f. It multiplies the number by 100 displaying it in a fixed format, followed by a percent sign. You can also specify the precision.&gt;&gt;&gt; total = 87&gt;&gt;&gt; true_pos = 34&gt;&gt;&gt; perc = true_pos / total&gt;&gt;&gt; perc0.39080459770114945&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"Percentage of true positive: {perc:%}\"'Percentage of true positive: 39.080460%'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"Percentage of true positive: {perc:.2%}\"'Percentage of true positive: 39.08%'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Justify or Add Padding to a F-StringYou can justify a string quite easily using &lt; or &gt; characters.  &gt;&gt;&gt; greetings = \"hello\"&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"She says {greetings:&gt;10}\"'She says      hello'# Pad 10 char to the right&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{greetings:&gt;10}\"'     hello'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{greetings:&lt;10}\"'hello     '# You can omit the &lt; for left padding&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{greetings:10}\"'hello     '    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    &gt;&gt;&gt; a = \"1\"&gt;&gt;&gt; b = \"21\"&gt;&gt;&gt; c = \"321\"&gt;&gt;&gt; d = \"4321\"&gt;&gt;&gt; print(\"\\n\".join((f\"{a:&gt;10}\", f\"{b:&gt;10}\", f\"{c:&gt;10}\", f\"{d:&gt;10}\")))         1        21       321      4321    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Escape CharactersIn case you want to display the variable name surrounded by the curly brackets instead of rendering its value, you can escape it using double {{&lt;expr&gt;}}.&gt;&gt;&gt; hello = \"world\"&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{{hello}} = {hello}\"'{hello} = world'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now, if you want to escape a double quote, you can use the backslash \\\".&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{hello} = \\\"hello\\\"\"'world = \"hello\"'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Center a StringCentering a string can be achieved by using var:^N where var is a variable you want to display and N is the string length. If N is shorter than the var, then Python display the whole string.&gt;&gt;&gt; hello = \"world\"&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{hello:^11}\"'   world   '&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{hello:*^11}\"'***world***'# Extra padding is added to the right&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{hello:*^10}\"'**world***'# N shorter than len(hello)&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{hello:^2}\"'world'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How To Add a Thousand Separatorf-strings also allow us to customize numbers. One common operation is to add an underscore to separate every thousand place.&gt;&gt;&gt; big_num = 1234567890&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{big_num:_}\"'1_234_567_890'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Format a Number With Commas as Decimal SeparatorIn fact, you can use any char as separator. It’s also possible to use a comma as separator.&gt;&gt;&gt; big_num = 1234567890&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{big_num:,}\"'1,234,567,890'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    You can also format a float with commas and set the precision in one go.&gt;&gt;&gt; num = 2343552.6516251625&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{num:,.3f}\"'2,343,552.652'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Format a Number With Spaces as Decimal SeparatorWhat about using spaces instead?Well, this one is a bit “hacky” but it works. You can use the , as separator, then replace it with space.&gt;&gt;&gt; big_num = 1234567890&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{big_num:,}\".replace(',', ' ')'1 234 567 890'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Another option is to set the locale of your environment to one that uses spaces as a thousand separator such as pl_PL. For more info, see this thread on stack overflow.      How to Format a Number in Scientific Notation (Exponential Notation)Formatting a number in scientific notation is possible with the e or E option.&gt;&gt;&gt; num = 2343552.6516251625&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{num:e}\"'2.343553e+06'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{num:E}\"'2.343553E+06'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{num:.2e}\"'2.34e+06'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{num:.4E}\"'2.3436E+06'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Using if-else Conditional in a F-Stringf-strings also evaluates more complex expressions such as inline if/else.&gt;&gt;&gt; a = \"this is a\"&gt;&gt;&gt; b = \"this is b\"&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{a if 10 &gt; 5 else b}\"'this is a'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{a if 10 &lt; 5 else b}\"'this is b'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Use F-String With a DictionaryYou can use dictionaries in a f-string. The only requirement is to use a different quotation mark than the one enclosing the expression.&gt;&gt;&gt; color = {\"R\": 123, \"G\": 145, \"B\": 255}&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{color['R']}\"'123'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{color[\"R\"]}'''123'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"RGB = ({color['R']}, {color['G']}, {color['B']})\"'RGB = (123, 145, 255)'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Concatenate F-StringsConcatenating f-strings is like concatenating regular strings, you can do that implicitly, or explicitly by applying the + operator or using str.join method.# Implicit string concatenation&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{123}\" \" = \" f\"{100}\" \" + \" f\"{20}\" \" + \" f\"{3}\"'123 = 100 + 20 + 3'# Explicity concatenation using '+' operator&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{12}\" + \" != \" + f\"{13}\"'12 != 13'# string concatenation using `str.join`&gt;&gt;&gt; \" \".join((f\"{13}\", f\"{45}\"))'13 45'&gt;&gt;&gt; \"#\".join((f\"{13}\", f\"{45}\"))'13#45'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Format datetime Objectsf-strings also support the formatting of datetime objects. The process is very similar to how str.format formats dates. For more info about the supported formats, check this  table  in the official docs.&gt;&gt;&gt; import datetime&gt;&gt;&gt; now = datetime.datetime.now()&gt;&gt;&gt; ten_days_ago = now - datetime.timedelta(days=10)&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{ten_days_ago:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}''2020-10-13 20:24:17'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{now:%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S}''2020-10-23 20:24:17'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Fix F-String's Invalid Syntax ErrorIf not used correctly, f-strings can raise a SyntaxError. The most common cause is using double-quotes inside a double quoted f-string. The same is also true for single quotes.&gt;&gt;&gt; color = {\"R\": 123, \"G\": 145, \"B\": 255}&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{color[\"R\"]}\"  File \"&lt;ipython-input-43-1a7f5d512400&gt;\", line 1    f\"{color[\"R\"]}\"    ^SyntaxError: f-string: unmatched '['&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{color['R']}'  File \"&lt;ipython-input-44-3499a4e3120c&gt;\", line 1    f'{color['R']}'    ^SyntaxError: f-string: unmatched '['    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Another common case is to use f-strings in older versions of Python. f-strings were introduced in Python 3.6. If you use it in an older version, the interpreter will raise a SyntaxError: invalid syntax.&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"this is an old version\"  File \"&lt;stdin&gt;\", line 1    f\"this is an old version\"                            ^SyntaxError: invalid syntax    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If you see invalid syntax, make sure to double check the Python version you are running. In my case, I tested in on Python 2.7, and you can find the version by calling sys.version.&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys; print(sys.version)2.7.18 (default, Apr 20 2020, 19:27:10) [GCC 8.3.0]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Add Leading ZerosYou can add leading zeros by adding using the format {expr:0len} where len is the length of the returned string. You can include a sign option. In this instance, + means the sign should be used for positive and negative numbers. The - is used only for negative numbers, which is the default behavior. For more info, check the  string format specification page .&gt;&gt;&gt; num = 42&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{num:05}\"'00042'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{num:+010}''+000000042'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{num:-010}''0000000042'&gt;&gt;&gt; f\"{num:010}\"'0000000042'&gt;&gt;&gt; num = -42&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{num:+010}''-000000042'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{num:010}''-000000042'&gt;&gt;&gt; f'{num:-010}''-000000042'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How to Write a Multi Line F-String (Dealing with New Lines)You can use the newline character \\n with f-strings to print a string in multiple lines.&gt;&gt;&gt; multi_line = (f'R: {color[\"R\"]}\\nG: {color[\"G\"]}\\nB: {color[\"B\"    ...: ]}\\n')&gt;&gt;&gt; multi_line'R: 123\\nG: 145\\nB: 255\\n'&gt;&gt;&gt; print(multi_line)R: 123G: 145B: 255    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    As an alternative, you can use triple quotes to represent the multi-line string. It not only allows you to add line breaks, it’s also possible to add TAB.&gt;&gt;&gt; other = f\"\"\"R: {color[\"R\"]}    ...: G: {color[\"G\"]}    ...: B: {color[\"B\"]}    ...: \"\"\"&gt;&gt;&gt; print(other)R: 123G: 145B: 255    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Example with TABs.&gt;&gt;&gt; other = f'''    ...: this is an example    ...:     ...: ^Iof color {color[\"R\"]}    ...:         ...: '''&gt;&gt;&gt; other'\\nthis is an example\\n\\n\\tof color 123\\n    \\n'&gt;&gt;&gt; print(other)this is an example    of color 123&gt;&gt;&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          ConclusionThat’s it for today, folks! I hope you’ve learned something different and useful. Knowing how to make the most out of f-string can make our lives so much easier.

There are always new tools, system<\/summary>s, and design patterns to learn, which leads to a great deal of confusion for newcomers. Daniel Molnar has dedicated his time to helping data professionals get back to basics through presentations at conferences and meetups, and with his most recent endeavor of building the Pipeline Data Engineering Academy. In this episode he shares advice on how to cut through the noise, which principles are foundational to building a successful career as a data engineer, and his approach to educating the next generation of data practitioners. This was a useful conversation for anyone working with data who has found themselves spending too much time chasing the latest trends and wishes to develop a more focused approach to their work.<\/details> | <p style=\"display:none\">2020-09-22 00:14:08<\/p>Tue 09/22<span style=\"color:gray\">\n(-54d)<\/span> | <a href=\"https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >Data Engineering Podcast<\/a>","<p style=\"display:none\">2020-09-19 03:00:00<\/p><a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/freakonomics-radio/one-does-not-know-where-an-insight-will-come-from\" style=\"     \" target=\"_blank\" >“One Does Not Know Where an Insight Will Come From” | People I (Mostly) Admire: Kerwin Charles<\/a><details><summary>The dean of Yale’s School of Management grew up in a small village in Guyana.

Rather than all of us abandoning what we're interested in and becoming CS majors, we can take our passion or expertise and 10x it with a little programming skill. In that case, we should be teaching kids fluency in programming at a younger age. And yet, almost every platform or example meant to do so pulls its punches. We'll teach kids programming concepts but not code itself. That's a bridge too far.But it's not! That's why I'm excited about Code Combat. It's an online coding platform that uses real Python syntax to guide your hero, visually, through a dungeon full of challenges. Yet the editor and customized error messages mean this is approachable for kids before they can even type reliably.On this episode, we'll meet Nick Winter, one of the cofounders of Code Combat.

Maybe you've heard of the Circuit Playground Express, BBC micro:bit, or the fancy Adafruit CLUE.  They aren't too expensive (ranging from $25 to $50 each). But for large groups such as classrooms, this can be a lot of money. Moreover, getting your hands on these devices can sometimes be tricky as well. With an extension for VS Code called Device simulator express, you can have instant access to all three (virtually of course). This cool extension adds a visual emulator as well as the native interactions such as buttons and temperature sensors.Get your IoT on without a real device using VS code today.
