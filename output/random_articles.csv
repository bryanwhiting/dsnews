Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#271 Unlock the mysteries of time, Python's datetime that is!",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/271/unlock-the-mysteries-of-time-pythons-datetime-that-is,"Time is a simple thing, right? And working with it in Python is great. You just import datetime and then (somewhat oddly) use the datetime class from that module.  Oh except, there are times with timezones, and times without. And why is there a total_seconds() but not total_minutes(), hours() or days() on timedelta? How about computing the number of weeks? What if you wanted to iterate over the next 22 workdays, skipping weekends?Ok, we'd better talk about time in Python! Good thing Paul Ganssle is here.
