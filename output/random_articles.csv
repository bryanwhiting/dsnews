Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#265 Why is Python slow?,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/265/why-is-python-slow,"The debate about whether Python is fast or slow is never-ending. It depends on what you're optimizing for: Server CPU consumption? Developer time? Maintainability? There are many factors. But if we keep our eye on pure computational speed in the Python layer, then yes, Python is slow. In this episode, we invite Anthony Shaw back on the show. He's here to dig into the reasons Python is computationally slower than many of its peer languages and technologies such as C++ and JavaScript.Links from the showAnthony's CPython Source Book: realpython.com/productsAnthony's PyCon Talk: youtube.comN-body problem example: github.comHPy project: github.comAustin profiler: github.comPrior episodes:#240: A guided tour of the CPython source: talkpython.fm#214: Dive into CPython 3.8: talkpython.fm#168: 10 Python security holes: talkpython.fmSponsorsBrilliantSentry Error Monitoring, Code TALKPYTHONTalk Python Training",2020-05-19T07:00:00Z,podcasts

It should cause you to leave relationships. It should cause you to reestablish boundaries with family members and with colleagues. It should cause you to quit your job. It should cause you to change your eating patterns. It should cause you to spend more time with yourself. It should cause it to change the books you read. It should cause us to change what your friends are. If it doesn't do that, it's not real examination. If it doesn't come attached with destruction of your current life, then you can't create the new life in which you will not have the anxiety."" — Naval Ravikant",2020-10-15T04:13:00Z,startups
