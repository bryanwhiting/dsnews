Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Proven Patterns For Building Successful Data Teams - Episode 162,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/data-teams-book-episode-162/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Building data products are complicated by the fact that there are so many different stakeholders with competing goals and priorities. It is also challenging because of the number of roles and capabilities that are necessary to go from idea to delivery. Different organizations have tried a multitude of organizational strategies to improve the success rate of these data teams with varying levels of success. In this episode Jesse Anderson shares the lessons that he has learned while working with dozens of businesses across industries to determine the team structures and communication styles that have generated the best results. If you are struggling to deliver value from big data, or just starting down the path of building the organizational capacity to turn raw information into valuable products then this is a conversation that you don't want to miss.",2020-12-07T23:45:54Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#279 Modern Python Developer's Toolkit,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/279/modern-python-developers-toolkit,"Python is quick and easy to learn. And yet, there is a massive gap between knowing the common aspects of the language (loops, variables, functions, and so on) and how to write a well-factored application using modern tools and libraries. That's where learning Python is a never-ending journey. Sebastian Witowski is here to give us his take on a modern Python developer's toolkit. There are a bunch of great tips in store for us.Links from the showSebastian on Twitter: @SebaWitowskiThe tutorial recording from PyCon: youtube.comSebastian’s website: switowski.comWorkshop resources site: pycon.switowski.comWriting Faster Python talk: youtube.comHugo Static Site Theme: gohugo.ioAnnouncements at Talk PythonPython Memory Course: talkpython.fm/memExcel to Python and Pandas Course: talkpython.fm/excelExcel to Python Webcast: talkpython.fm/excel-webcastTeam Cohorts: talkpython.fm/cohortsSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-29T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#296 Python in F1 racing,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/296/python-in-f1-racing,"Quick: Name the 3 most advanced engineering organizations you can think of? Maybe an aerospace company such as SpaceX or Boeing come to mind. Maybe you thought of CERN and the LHC. But in terms of bespoke engineering capabilities, you should certainly put the F1 racing teams on your list. These organizations appear as 20-30 people on a race day shown on TV. But in fact, the number of people back at the home base doing the engineering work can be over 500 employees. Almost every tiny part you see on these cars as well as the tools to maintain them are custom-built.The engineering problems solved are immense. Would it surprise you to know that Python is playing a major role here? On this episode, you'll meet Joe Borg who help pioneer Python's adoption at several F1 teams.Links from the showJoe's website: josephb.orgJoe on Twitter: @joedborgRacing Point F1 team: racingpointf1.comScuderia Alpha Tauri F1 team: scuderiaalphatauri.comMicroK8s: microk8s.ioCharmed Kubernetes: ubuntu.com/kubernetesSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-12-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

One of the more complex aspects is that of access control to the data assets that an organization is responsible for managing. The team at Immuta has built a platform that aims to tackle that problem in a flexible and maintainable fashion so that data teams can easily integrate authorization, data masking, and privacy enhancing technologies into their data infrastructure. In this episode Steve Touw and Stephen Bailey share what they have built at Immuta, how it is implemented, and how it streamlines the workflow for everyone involved in working with sensitive data. If you are starting down the path of implementing a data governance strategy then this episode will provide a great overview of what is involved.",2020-12-21T23:10:14Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
