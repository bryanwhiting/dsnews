Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Bringing Feature Stores and MLOps to the Enterprise At Tecton - Episode 166,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/tecton-mlops-feature-store-episode-166/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"As more organizations are gaining experience with data management and incorporating analytics into their decision making, their next move is to adopt machine learning. In order to make those efforts sustainable, the core capability they need is for data scientists and analysts to be able to build and deploy features in a self service manner. As a result the feature store is becoming a required piece of the data platform. To fill that need Kevin Stumpf and the team at Tecton are building an enterprise feature store as a service. In this episode he explains how his experience building the Michelanagelo platform at Uber has informed the design and architecture of Tecton, how it integrates with your existing data systems, and the elements that are required for well engineered feature store.",2021-01-05T00:44:57Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system.
