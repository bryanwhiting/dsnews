Do you struggle loading large amounts of data or wonder what parts of your code use the maximum amount of memory? Maybe you just want to require smaller compute resources (servers, RAM, and so on).   If so, this episode is for you. We have Itamar Turner-Trauring, creator of the Python data science memory profiler FIL here to talk memory usage and data science.Links from the showItamar on twitter: @itamarstFIL: pythonspeed.comPython Bytes coverage of FIL: pythonbytes.fmVideo: Small Big Data: using NumPy and Pandas when your data doesn't fit in memory: youtube.comSoftware Engineering for Data Scientists Article: pythonspeed.comPython Tutor: pythontutor.comWeak references: docs.python.orgmemory_profiler package: github.comAustin profiler: github.comWSL2 on Windows: pbpython.com/wsl-python.htmlSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-24T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

On this episode, you'll meet Robert ""Kane"" Replogle, who works on the simulation and test software at Richard Childress Racing. The NASCAR team that just finished #1 and 2 in at the Texas Motor Speedway. You'll hear how Python is allowing them to model car behavior, air flow, and more much faster than others using outdated tools.

The specifics of how it works varies from browser to browser, but there is a de facto set of features that are typically provided.⁣⁣⁣⁣Today we'll be looking at the following methods:⁣⁣console.log()⁣⁣console.warn()⁣⁣console.error()⁣⁣console.clear()⁣⁣console.time() &amp; console.timeEnd()⁣⁣console.table()⁣⁣console.count()⁣⁣console.group() &amp; console.groupEnd()⁣⁣      console LOGMainly use to log(print) the output the console. We can put any type inside the log(), be it a string, array, object, boolean, etc.console.log('@rahxul')console.log(30);console.log(true);    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          console WARNUsed to log warning message to the console. By default, the warning message will be highlighted with yellow colour.console.warn('warn in console');    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          console ERRORUsed to log error message to the console. Useful in the testing of the code. By default, the warning message will be highlighted with red colour.console.error('error in console!');    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          console CLEARUsed to the clear console. In the case of chrome, a simple overlayed text will be printed like : 'Console was cleared' while in firefox no message is returned.console.clear();    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          console TIME &amp; TIMEENDWhenever we want to know the amount of tie spend by a blog or a function, we can make use of the time() and timeEnd() methods provided by the console.console.time('time');const func = ( ) =&gt; console.log('func is running...'); const func2 = ( ) =&gt; console.log ('func2 is running...');func();func2();console.timeEnd('time');    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          console TABLEThis method allows us to generate a table inside a console. The input must be an array or an object which will be shown as a table.console.table( {a:1, b:2, c:3});    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          console COUNTThis method is used to count the number that the function hit by this counting method.for( let i=0; i&lt;5; i++) {     console.count( ); }    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          console GROUP &amp; GROUPENDThese methods of the console object allow us to group contents in a separate block, which will be intended.console.group( 'Group 1' );      console.log( 'Simple log in a group' );     console.group( 'Group1.1' );          console.log( 'LSimple log in a subgroup' );     console.groupEnd( 'Group1.1' );console.groupEnd( 'Group 1' )console.log( 'Outside the group!' );    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    ⚡Happy Coding",2020-11-25T07:44:12Z,#datascience #tutorials
