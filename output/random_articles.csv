Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#282 pre-commit framework,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/282/pre-commit-framework,"Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before committing your code. Hooks run on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as trailing whitespace and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks. As we created more libraries and projects we recognized that sharing our pre-commit hooks across projects is painful. That's why I'm happy to welcome Anthony Sottile to the show to discuss  pre-commit, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.Links from the showAnthony at Twitter: @codewithanthonypre-commit: pre-commit.compre-commit continuous integration: pre-commit.cipre-commit hooks: pre-commit.com/hooks.htmlpre-commit on GitHub: github.comshhgit secret discovery project: github.combabi editor: github.comTwitch stream: twitch.tvAnthony on GitHub: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-17T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Keeping A Bigeye On The Data Quality Market - Episode 160,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/bigeye-data-quality-market-episode-160/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"One of the oldest aphorisms about data is ""garbage in, garbage out"", which is why the current boom in data quality solutions is no surprise. With the growth in projects, platforms, and services that aim to help you establish and maintain control of the health and reliability of your data pipelines it can be overwhelming to stay up to date with how they all compare. In this episode Egor Gryaznov, CTO of Bigeye, joins the show to explore the landscape of data quality companies, the general strategies that they are using, and what problems they solve. He also shares how his own product is designed and the challenges that are involved in building a system to help data engineers manage the complexity of a data platform. If you are wondering how to get better control of your own pipelines and the traps to avoid then this episode is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-23T23:26:25Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Self Service Data Management From Ingest To Insights With Isima - Episode 159,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/isima-data-management-platform-episode-159/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The core mission of data engineers is to provide the business with a way to ask and answer questions of their data. This often takes the form of business intelligence dashboards, machine learning models, or APIs on top of a cleaned and curated data set. Despite the rapid progression of impressive tools and products built to fulfill this mission, it is still an uphill battle to tie everything together into a cohesive and reliable platform. At Isima they decided to reimagine the entire ecosystem from the ground up and built a single unified platform to allow end-to-end self service workflows from data ingestion through to analysis. In this episode CEO and co-founder of Isima Darshan Rawal explains how the biOS platform is architected to enable ease of use, the challenges that were involved in building an entirely new system from scratch, and how it can integrate with the rest of your data platform to allow for incremental adoption. This was an interesting and contrarian take on the current state of the data management industry and is worth a listen to gain some additional perspective.",2020-11-17T01:35:57Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

One of the more complex aspects is that of access control to the data assets that an organization is responsible for managing. The team at Immuta has built a platform that aims to tackle that problem in a flexible and maintainable fashion so that data teams can easily integrate authorization, data masking, and privacy enhancing technologies into their data infrastructure. In this episode Steve Touw and Stephen Bailey share what they have built at Immuta, how it is implemented, and how it streamlines the workflow for everyone involved in working with sensitive data. If you are starting down the path of implementing a data governance strategy then this episode will provide a great overview of what is involved.",2020-12-21T23:10:14Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
