Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#286 Python and ML at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/286/python-and-ml-at-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-jpl,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field. And he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chrismattmannChris at JPL: jpl.nasa.govNature: A vision for data science: nature.comOpen source at JPL: github.comApache Nutch: nutch.apache.org7 Minutes of Terror: The Challenges of Getting to Mars: youtube.comtqdm package: pypi.orgPanama Papers: wikipedia.orgSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-16T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#290 Side Hustles for Data Scientists,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/290/side-hustles-for-data-scientists,"Are you a data scientist looking to branch out on your own and start something new? Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job, and hoping things work out, maybe you should start with a side-hustle. On this episode, you'll meet Keith McCormick, a data scientist who has many irons in the fire and he's here to tell us about different types of side hustles and why you may want to try or avoid one.Links from the showKeith on Twitter: @kmccormickblogKeith on LinkedIn: linkedin.comKeith's courses: linkedin.comSide Hustle Strategies for Data Science and Analytics Experts course: linkedin.com/learningTalk Python's Excel to Python course: talkpython.fm/excelSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-11-13T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
