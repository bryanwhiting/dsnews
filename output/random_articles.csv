Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#292 Pythonic identity (auth in Python ecosystem),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/292/pythonic-identity-auth-in-python-ecosystem,"So you're excited about that next app you're about to build. You can visualize the APIs with the smooth scalability taking to the mobile apps. You can see how, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime. What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form and integrating mail capabilities just for this purpose. Or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.Don't worry, we got you covered. Our guests, Christos Matskas and John Patrick Dandison are here to cover a bunch of different libraries and techniques we can use for adding identity to our Python applications.Links from the showChristos on Twitter: @christosmatskasJohn Patrick Dandison on Twitter: @azureandchillshhgit live: shhgit.comTwitch channel for Christos and JP: twitch.tv/425showPasslib & Folding: passlib.readthedocs.ioMicrosoft Authentication Library: github.com/AzureADauthlib - JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption draft implementation: github.comdjango-allauth - Authentication app for Django that ""just works"": github.comdjango-oauth-toolkit - OAuth 2 goodies for Django: github.compython-oauth2 - A fully tested, abstract interface to creating OAuth clients and servers: github.compython-social-auth - An easy-to-setup social authentication mechanism: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-26T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Bringing Feature Stores and MLOps to the Enterprise At Tecton - Episode 166,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/tecton-mlops-feature-store-episode-166/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"As more organizations are gaining experience with data management and incorporating analytics into their decision making, their next move is to adopt machine learning. In order to make those efforts sustainable, the core capability they need is for data scientists and analysts to be able to build and deploy features in a self service manner. As a result the feature store is becoming a required piece of the data platform. To fill that need Kevin Stumpf and the team at Tecton are building an enterprise feature store as a service. In this episode he explains how his experience building the Michelanagelo platform at Uber has informed the design and architecture of Tecton, how it integrates with your existing data systems, and the elements that are required for well engineered feature store.",2021-01-05T00:44:57Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

One of the more complex aspects is that of access control to the data assets that an organization is responsible for managing. The team at Immuta has built a platform that aims to tackle that problem in a flexible and maintainable fashion so that data teams can easily integrate authorization, data masking, and privacy enhancing technologies into their data infrastructure. In this episode Steve Touw and Stephen Bailey share what they have built at Immuta, how it is implemented, and how it streamlines the workflow for everyone involved in working with sensitive data. If you are starting down the path of implementing a data governance strategy then this episode will provide a great overview of what is involved.",2020-12-21T23:10:14Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
