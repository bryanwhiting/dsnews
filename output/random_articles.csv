Often we think of maps, but maps are static. GIS gets interesting when you realize that we're studying and visualizing data flowing through these locations and communities.

Along with the benefits there are some additional complexities to consider, including how to safely integrate new data sources or test out changes to existing pipelines. In order to address these challenges the team at Treeverse created LakeFS to introduce version control capabilities to your storage layer. In this episode Einat Orr and Oz Katz explain how they implemented branching and merging capabilities for object storage, best practices for how to use versioning primitives to introduce changes to your data lake, how LakeFS is architected, and how you can start using it for your own data platform.",2020-11-03T00:47:03Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

While there are a number of platforms available for building that catalog, many of them are either difficult to deploy and integrate, or expensive to use at scale. In this episode Grant Seward explains how he built Tree Schema to be an easy to use and cost effective option for organizations to build their data catalogs. He also shares the internal architecture, how he approached the design to make it accessible and easy to use, and how it autodiscovers the schemas and metadata for your source systems.",2020-11-10T02:48:31Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Using a REST API in react,https://dev.to/tkbraincodes/using-a-rest-api-in-react-f6n,"WHAT IS AN APIAn API stands for an ""Application Programming Interface"". It allows communication between softwares and provides ways of sharing data between applications. The REST API stands for ""Representational State Transfer"".REST API is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints and allows communication with RESTful  web service. The REST API uses the HTTP request method to access and use data.      API METHODSBelow are the REST API methods:Get Method: As the name implies, it gets the data directly from the API.Post Method: The post method is used to give back data collected from the application to the server or an API.Put Method: This action is used to make changes and update a request.Delete Method: This method is used to eradicate pieces of information or data that are not needed.For this article, we are using a free API to demonstrate how to use the API call in react.      PROJECT SETUP:Run this code in your command prompt to create a new react app.npx create-react-app api-usagethen cd into the app:cd api-usagerun yarn start or npm start yarn startnpm start You should see the react logo spinning in your browser      API FOR THIS PROJECT:link to api: icanhazdadjoke.comIn this project, we are going to use Axios. Axios is used for making HTTP requests and used for fetching data from an API or a database or XMLRequests.Run: npm i axiosInside your App.js get rid of everything and it should look like this:import React from 'react';import './App.css';function App() {  return (    &lt;div className=""App""&gt;         {/*No component yet*/}    &lt;/div&gt;  );}export default App;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then inside the src folder create a new component Joke.js.Since we installed Axios earlier we are going to import it into our app.import React from 'react';import axios from 'axios';const Joke = () =&gt; {return (   &lt;div&gt;      &lt;h1&gt;Jokes:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;);}export default Joke;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          From the code above:We are creating a new Joke component and rendering an h1, then we export the Joke component by default.Next, we import the Joke component into the App.js component so that it can be displayed in the browser.import React from 'react';import Joke from './Joke';import './App.css';function App() {  return (    &lt;div className=""App""&gt;         {/*Joke component*/}           &lt;Joke/&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  );}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    In your browser, you should see Joke: displaying on the screen:Next, I am going to show how to use the API in our code.import React, {useState} from 'react';import axios from 'axios';function Joke = () =&gt; {     //create a state to store the jokes from the apiconst [joke, setJoke]  useState([]); //make sure you to import useState from react//store the api in a variable    const apiLink = ""https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"";//create a function to fetch the data const fetchData = async () =&gt; {        const res = await axios.get(`${apiLink}`, { headers: { Accept: ""application/json"" } });        console.log(res.data);        console.log(res.data.joke)    }return (   &lt;div&gt;      &lt;h1&gt;Jokes:&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;/div&gt;);}export default Joke;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          From the code above:I created a state const [joke, setJoke] = useState([])to store the data from the api and created a function fetchData to fetch data from the api that was stored in the variable const apiLink = ""https://icanhazdadjoke.com/""; then created the response variable const res = await axios.get(${apiLink}, { headers: { Accept: ""application/json"" } }).We use async and await to wait for the data any time it fetches it. We also logged the data to the browser console so we can see what we fetched from the API. If you open your browser console by pressing f12 you will see the data from the API in an object {data}.Next we are going to be displaying the jokes inside our browser.Let's go 🚀🚀🚀...//imports ....const Joke = () =&gt; {    const [joke, setJokes] = useState([]);    const apiLink = ""https://icanhazdadjoke.com/"";    const fetchData = async () =&gt; {        const res = await axios.get(`${apiLink}`, { headers: { Accept: ""application/json"" } });        console.log(res.data.joke);        setJokes([res.data.joke]);    }    return (        &lt;div className=""joke__""&gt;            &lt;h1&gt;Jokes:&lt;/h1&gt;               {/*Fetch data from url*/}                &lt;button onClick={fetchData}&gt;Load jokes&lt;/button&gt;                     {/*data from api goes here*/}                    {joke &amp;&amp; joke.map((j, index) =&gt; (                         &lt;div className=""data"" key={index}&gt;                          {j}                         &lt;/div&gt;                     ))}        &lt;/div&gt;    )}export default Joke;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          From the code above:In the fetchData function, we set the state to the response of every joke we get from the API setJokes([res.data.joke]);.In the return statement we passed in the fetchData function to a button, for any time we click the button it loads new jokes &lt;button onClick={fetchData}&gt;Load jokes&lt;/button&gt;.      From the code below:We are mapping through the joke array if there is any joke, and returning the joke from the API in a div.  {/*data from api goes here*/}                    {joke &amp;&amp; joke.map((j, index) =&gt; (                         &lt;div className=""data"" key={index}&gt;                          {j}                         &lt;/div&gt;                     ))}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now start your app you would see Joke: and Load jokes displaying. When you click on the Load jokes button new jokes are displayed. It should look like this:      Summary:In this article, we have seen how to use a REST API in react. By using the GET method to get data from the API icanhazdadjoke.com in JSON format then incorporating that data into our application.You reach out to me on Twitter @tkworldclass😉",2020-12-29T14:15:50Z,#datascience #tutorials
