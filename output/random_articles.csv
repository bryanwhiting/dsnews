Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#283 Web scraping, the 2020 edition",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/283/web-scraping-the-2020-edition,"Web scraping is pulling the HTML of a website down and parsing useful data out of it. The use-cases for this type of functionality are endless. Have a bunch of data on governmental sites that are only listed online in HTML without a download? There's an API for that! Do you want to keep abreast of what your competitors are featuring on their site? There's an API for that. Need alerts for changes on a website, for example enrollment is now open at your college and you want to be first to get in and avoid the 8am Monday morning course slot? There's an API for that. That API is screen scraping and Attila Tóth from ScrapingHub is here to tell us all about it.Links from the showAttila Tóth on LinkedIn: linkedin.comScrapy project: scrapy.orgScrapinghub on Twitter: @scrapinghubScrapinghub: scrapinghub.comcookiecutter template for Scrapy projects: github.comSplash: headless browser designed specifically for web scraping: scrapinghub.com/splashAwesome Web Scraping list: github.comTalk Python episode 50 on web scraping: talkpython.fmHow Web Scraping is Revealing Lobbying and Corruption in Peru: blog.scrapinghub.comWeb Data Extraction Summit event: extractsummit.ioSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,System Observability For The Cloud Native Era With Chronosphere - Episode 170,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/chronosphere-metrics-observability-episode-170/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Collecting and processing metrics for monitoring use cases is an interesting data problem. It is eminently possible to generate millions or billions of data points per second, the information needs to be propagated to a central location, processed, and analyzed in timeframes on the order of milliseconds or single-digit seconds, and the consumers of the data need to be able to query the information quickly and flexibly. As the systems that we build continue to grow in scale and complexity the need for reliable and manageable monitoring platforms increases proportionately. In this episode Rob Skillington, CTO of Chronosphere, shares his experiences building metrics systems that provide observability to companies that are operating at extreme scale. He describes how the M3DB storage engine is designed to manage the pressures of a critical system component, the inherent complexities of working with telemetry data, and the motivating factors that are contributing to the growing need for flexibility in querying the collected metrics. This is a fascinating conversation about an area of data management that is often taken for granted.",2021-02-02T02:59:59Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Using Your Data Warehouse As The Source Of Truth For Customer Data With Hightouch - Episode 168,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/hightouch-customer-data-warehouse-episode-168/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The data warehouse has become the central component of the modern data stack. Building on this pattern, the team at Hightouch have created a platform that synchronizes information about your customers out to third party systems for use by marketing and sales teams. In this episode Tejas Manohar explains the benefits of sourcing customer data from one location for all of your organization to use, the technical challenges of synchronizing the data to external systems with varying APIs, and the workflow for enabling self-service access to your customer data by your marketing teams. This is an interesting conversation about the importance of the data warehouse and how it can be used beyond just internal analytics.",2021-01-19T02:16:10Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field. And he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chrismattmannChris at JPL: jpl.nasa.govNature: A vision for data science: nature.comOpen source at JPL: github.comApache Nutch: nutch.apache.org7 Minutes of Terror: The Challenges of Getting to Mars: youtube.comtqdm package: pypi.orgPanama Papers: wikipedia.orgSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-16T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

This means that it makes use of randomness as part of the search process. This makes the algorithm appropriate for nonlinear objective functions where other local search algorithms do not operate well.
