Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#279 Modern Python Developer's Toolkit,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/279/modern-python-developers-toolkit,"Python is quick and easy to learn. And yet, there is a massive gap between knowing the common aspects of the language (loops, variables, functions, and so on) and how to write a well-factored application using modern tools and libraries. That's where learning Python is a never-ending journey. Sebastian Witowski is here to give us his take on a modern Python developer's toolkit. There are a bunch of great tips in store for us.Links from the showSebastian on Twitter: @SebaWitowskiThe tutorial recording from PyCon: youtube.comSebastian’s website: switowski.comWorkshop resources site: pycon.switowski.comWriting Faster Python talk: youtube.comHugo Static Site Theme: gohugo.ioAnnouncements at Talk PythonPython Memory Course: talkpython.fm/memExcel to Python and Pandas Course: talkpython.fm/excelExcel to Python Webcast: talkpython.fm/excel-webcastTeam Cohorts: talkpython.fm/cohortsSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-29T00:00:00Z,podcasts

The use-cases for this type of functionality are endless. Have a bunch of data on governmental sites that are only listed online in HTML without a download? There's an API for that! Do you want to keep abreast of what your competitors are featuring on their site? There's an API for that. Need alerts for changes on a website, for example enrollment is now open at your college and you want to be first to get in and avoid the 8am Monday morning course slot? There's an API for that.

Richard Campbell, a developer and podcaster who also dives deep into science and tech topics, is back for our second GeekOut episode. Last time we geeked out about the real science and progress around a moon base. This time it's why is there life on Earth, where could it be or have been in the solar system, and beyond. In case you didn't catch the first GeekOut, episode 253, this one is more of a general science and tech episode. I love digging into the deep internals of all the tools of the Python space, but given all that is going on in the world, I thought it'd be fun to take a step back and just enjoy some fun geekery and give you all something to just sit back and let your mind dream.Links from the showRichard on Twitter: @richcampbellAll Richard's GeekOut Episodes: geekout.showMoonbase Geekout Episode: talkpython.fm/253High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC): sacd.larc.nasa.govNew Horizons: solarsystem.nasa.govThe Planets: Saturn - NOVA documentary (Cassini): pbs.orgMission to Jupiter - Galileo: jpl.nasa.govSponsorsBrilliantTalk Python Training",2020-08-06T00:00:00Z,podcasts
