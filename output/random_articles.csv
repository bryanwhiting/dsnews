Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#273 CoCalc: A fully colloborative notebook development environment,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/273/cocalc-a-fully-colloborative-notebook-development-environment,"Everyone in the Python space is familiar with Notebooks these days. One of the original notebook environments was SageMath. Created by William Stein, and collaborators, it began as an open-source, Python-based, computational environment focused on mathematicians. It has since grown into a full-blown company and has become a proper collaborative environment for things like Jupyter notebooks, Linux-backed Bash shells, and much more. Think Google Docs but across all these facets of development in your browser.We welcome back William Stein to give us an update on his journey from professor to entrepreneur building CoCalc along the way.Links from the showWilliam on Twitter: @wstein389CoCalc: cocalc.comEpisode 59 about SageMath: talkpython.fm/59Comparing CoCalc to other products: cocalc.comExamples/Gallery: share.cocalc.comSageMath: sagemath.orgX11 server: xpra.orgSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-18T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

To ensure that your pipelines are healthy you need a way to make them observable. In this episode Barr Moses and Lior Gavish, co-founders of Monte Carlo, share the leading causes of what they refer to as data downtime and how it manifests. They also discuss methods for gaining visibility into the flow of data through your infrastructure, how to diagnose and prevent potential problems, and what they are building at Monte Carlo to help you maintain your data's uptime.",2020-10-19T23:12:09Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#293 Learning how to learn as a developer,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/293/learning-how-to-learn-as-a-developer,"As software developers, we live in a world of uncertainty and flux. Do you need to build a new web app? Well maybe using Django makes the most sense if you've been doing it for a long time. There is Flask, but it's more mix and match being a microframework. But you've also heard that async and await are game changers and FastAPI might be the right choice. Whatever it is you're building, there is constant pressure to stay on top of a moving target. Learning is not something you do in school then get a job as a developer. No, it a constant and critical part of your career. That's why we all need to be good, very good, at it.Matt Harrison is back on Talk Python to talk to us about some tips, tricks, and even science about learning as software developers.Links from the showMatt on Twitter: @__mharrison__Matt's Learning Course (use code TALKPYTHON20 for 20% off): mattharrison.podia.comFriends of the show: talkpython.fm/friends-of-the-showStreamlit: streamlit.ioJupyter LSP: github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lspSponsorsBrilliantLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

While there are a number of platforms available for building that catalog, many of them are either difficult to deploy and integrate, or expensive to use at scale. In this episode Grant Seward explains how he built Tree Schema to be an easy to use and cost effective option for organizations to build their data catalogs. He also shares the internal architecture, how he approached the design to make it accessible and easy to use, and how it autodiscovers the schemas and metadata for your source systems.",2020-11-10T02:48:31Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
