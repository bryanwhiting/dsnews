Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#299 Personal search engine with datasette and dogsheep,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/299/personal-search-engine-with-datasette-and-dogsheep,"In this episode, we'll be discussing two powerful tools for data reporting and exploration: Datasette and Dogsheep.Datasette helps people take data of any shape or size, analyze and explore it, and publish it as an interactive website and accompanying API.Dogsheep is a collection of tools for personal analytics using SQLite and Datasette. Imagine a unified search engine for everything personal in your life such as twitter, photos, google docs, todoist, goodreads, and more, all in once place and outside of cloud companies.On this episode we talk with Simon Willison who created both of these projects. He's also one of the co-creators of Django and we'll discuss some early Django history!Links from the showDatasette: datasette.ioDogsheep: dogsheep.github.ioDatasheet newsletter: datasette.substack.comVideo: Build your own data warehouse for personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette: youtube.comExamplesList: github.comPersonal data warehouses: github.comGlobal power plants: datasettes.comSF data: datasettes.comFiveThirtyEight: fivethirtyeight.datasettes.comLahman’s Baseball Database: baseballdb.lawlesst.netLive demo of current main: datasette.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2021-01-17T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Self Service Open Source Data Integration With AirByte - Episode 173,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/airbyte-open-source-data-integration-episode-173/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Data integration is a critical piece of every data pipeline, yet it is still far from being a solved problem. There are a number of managed platforms available, but the list of options for an open source system that supports a large variety of sources and destinations is still embarrasingly short. The team at Airbyte is adding a new entry to that list with the goal of making robust and easy to use data integration more accessible to teams who want or need to maintain full control of their data. In this episode co-founders John Lafleur and Michel Tricot share the story of how and why they created Airbyte, discuss the project's design and architecture, and explain their vision of what an open soure data integration platform should offer. If you are struggling to maintain your extract and load pipelines or spending time on integrating with a new system when you would prefer to be working on other projects then this is definitely a conversation worth listening to.",2021-02-23T02:04:59Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#292 Pythonic identity (auth in Python ecosystem),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/292/pythonic-identity-auth-in-python-ecosystem,"So you're excited about that next app you're about to build. You can visualize the APIs with the smooth scalability taking to the mobile apps. You can see how, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime. What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form and integrating mail capabilities just for this purpose. Or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.Don't worry, we got you covered. Our guests, Christos Matskas and John Patrick Dandison are here to cover a bunch of different libraries and techniques we can use for adding identity to our Python applications.Links from the showChristos on Twitter: @christosmatskasJohn Patrick Dandison on Twitter: @azureandchillshhgit live: shhgit.comTwitch channel for Christos and JP: twitch.tv/425showPasslib & Folding: passlib.readthedocs.ioMicrosoft Authentication Library: github.com/AzureADauthlib - JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption draft implementation: github.comdjango-allauth - Authentication app for Django that ""just works"": github.comdjango-oauth-toolkit - OAuth 2 goodies for Django: github.compython-oauth2 - A fully tested, abstract interface to creating OAuth clients and servers: github.compython-social-auth - An easy-to-setup social authentication mechanism: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-26T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

For each new source that they need to integrate with it is another custom set of ETL tasks that they need to maintain. In order to reduce the friction involved in supporting new data transformations David Molot and Hassan Syyid built the Hotlue platform. In this episode they describe the data integration challenges facing many B2B companies, how their work on the Hotglue platform simplifies their efforts, and how they have designed the platform to make these ETL workloads embeddable and self service for end users.",2021-01-26T02:05:21Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
