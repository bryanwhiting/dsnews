Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#286 Python and ML at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/286/python-and-ml-at-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-jpl,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field. And he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chrismattmannChris at JPL: jpl.nasa.govNature: A vision for data science: nature.comOpen source at JPL: github.comApache Nutch: nutch.apache.org7 Minutes of Terror: The Challenges of Getting to Mars: youtube.comtqdm package: pypi.orgPanama Papers: wikipedia.orgSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-16T07:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#285 Dask as a Platform Service with Coiled,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/285/dask-as-a-platform-service-with-coiled,"If you're into data science, you've probably heard about Dask. It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters. While powerful, this may take some serious setup to execute in its full glory. That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson and others to launch a business to help Python loving data scientists run Dask workloads in the cloud. And they are here to tell us about they open-source foundation business.And they must be on to something, between recording and releasing this episode, they raised $5M in VC funding.Links from the showHugo on Twitter: @hugobowneMatthew on Twitter: @mrocklinCoiled: coiled.ioCoiled raised $5M in Sept: twitter.comA brief history of dask article: coiled.io/blogCoiled: Dask for Everyone, Everywhere: medium.comThe incredible growth of python: stackoverflow.blogGrowth updated (SO Trends current): insights.stackoverflow.comCoiled Youtube channel: youtube.comSnorkel package: pypi.orgSponsorsBrilliantMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-09T07:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
