Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#291 Operational Resilience with Pyomo,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/291/operational-resilience-with-pyomo,"Do you have a scientific system that needs optimization or solving? Our guest, on this episode, Clark Petri is here to tell us all about pyomo. This is a library that can solve all sorts of cool problems, linear programming, nonlinear equations, and many other things you can throw at it.  We're gonna solve a really fun diet problem: What is the most nutritious meal that you can eat for the least amount of money? The answer might surprise you a little bit! It's going to be a lot of fun. So listen in to hear about how Clark has used pyomo to do his work and how you might use it in yours.Links from the showPyomo: pyomo.orgClark on Twitter: @clarkpetriCenter for Infrastructure Defense: nps.eduThesis: apps.dtic.milI’m not alone in my work post: morenuance.comhandcalcs package: github.comDiet optimization problem: nbviewer.jupyter.orgTalk Python [Pro Edition]: talkpython.fm/proBlack Friday at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/blackfridaySponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-22T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Destructuring Assignment Indepth Syntax Comparison - JavaScript Vs Python,https://dev.to/devdios/destructuring-assignment-indepth-syntax-comparison-javascript-vs-python-2nl5,"The destructuring or an unpacking assignment syntax is an expression that makes it possible to unpack values from iterables like array and objects in javascript and list, tuples, dictionaries in Python into distinct variables.This post will look at the difference in syntax used in Python and JavaScript for destructuring or unpacking assignments.Unstructuring assignment is quite useful as it allows us to assign values to several variables at once from a single collection, is easy to understand and improves code-readability(if there exist such a term). One simple examples includes performing swap operation on two variables,Pythona = 5 b = 7b, a = a, bprint(a, b, sep = "" "") # 7 5    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    JavaScriptlet a = 5, b = 7[b, a] = [a, b]console.log(a, b)// 7 5     Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Array/List DestructuringPythonexample_list = [1, 2, 3]first, second, third = example_listprint(first, second, third, sep = "" "") # 1 2 3    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The above code snippet shows a simple list destructing in Python. Here the assignment of variables depends simply upon the order of items in the list.JavaScriptconst example_array = [1, 2, 3]let first, second, third[first, second, third] = example_arrayconsole.log(first, second, third)// 1 2 3    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Array Destructuring in JavaScript requires variable to be enclosed with ""[ ]""      Ignoring valuesPythonexample_list = [1, 2, 3]first, _ , third = example_listprint(first, third, sep = "" "")# 1 3    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The values to ignored are to be replaced with ' _ 'JavaScriptconst example_array = [1, 2, 3]const [first, , third] = example_arrayconsole.log(first, third)// 1 3    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The values to be ignored are just empty with commas after them.In Python, if we try to destructure a collection with more or fewer values than we provide variables, we end up with a ValueError. Whereas in Javascript it will not show any errorPythonexample_list = [1, 2, 3]first, second = example_list#ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    JavaScriptconst example_array = [1, 2, 3]let first, second, third, fourth//when destructuring less values[first, second] = example_arrayconsole.log(first, second)// 1 2//when destructuring more values[first, second, third, fourth] = example_arrayconsole.log(first, second, third, fourth)// 1 2 3 undefined    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    In JavaScript, When unpacking less number of values, only the initial values are assigned, while unpacking of more number of values, the only the first three variables are assigned a value, and the last remains as undefined.In such a scenario, JavaScript allows us to use a default value:[first, second, third, fourth = 4] = example_arrayconsole.log(first, second, third, fourth)// 1 2 3 4    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Collecting ValuesPythonhead, *tail = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]print(head)  # 1print(tail)  # [2, 3, 4, 5]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    JavaScriptconst [head, ...tail] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]console.log(head) // 1console.log(tail) // [2, 3, 4, 5]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    ... is known as ""rest"" operator in JavaScript Be aware that a SyntaxError will be thrown if a trailing comma is used on the right-hand side of a rest element:const [a, ...b,] = [1, 2, 3];// SyntaxError: rest element may not have a trailing comma// Always consider using rest operator as the last element    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Args/Kwargs in Python and Object Destructuring in JavaScriptIn Python, we can pass a variable number of arguments to a function using special symbols. There are two special symbols:*args (Non Keyword Arguments)**kwargs (Keyword Arguments)A typical example where one might need something like *args is given below:// a standard function to add two numbersdef adder(x,y):    print(""sum:"",x+y)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    If we are to add multiple numbers but are unsure of how many numbers we'll have to addWe can modify adder in two ways:we can put the numbers to be added to a list and pass the list as an argument.def adder(nums):    sum = 0    for num in nums:         sum += num    print(""sum : "", sum)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    But this requires to add maintain a list and remove and add numbers to list accordingly.This is where *args comes into play:Python has *args which allow us to pass the variable number of non keyword arguments to function.modifying the adder functions using *args:def adder(*num):    sum = 0    for n in num:        sum = sum + n    print(""sum:"",sum)# args is just a conventional name used in python, we can use any name# (like num in this example)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We use *args and **kwargs as an argument when we are unsure about the number of arguments to pass in the functions.*args allow to pass mulitple arguments to function while **kwargs allows to pass multiple keyword arguments to a function.def printSomething(a, *args, **kwargs):    print(a)    print(args)    print(kwargs)printSomething(1, 2, 3, 4, name=""Sachin"", age=21)# 1# (2, 3, 4) - args becomes a tuple# {'name': 'Sachin', 'age': 21} - kwargs becomes a dictionary    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    *args functionality can be replicated in JS using rest operator as:// Only the last parameter can be a ""rest parameter"".function myFun(a,  b, ...manyMoreArgs) {  console.log(""a"", a)  console.log(""b"", b)  console.log(""manyMoreArgs"", manyMoreArgs)}myFun(""one"", ""two"", ""three"", ""four"", ""five"", ""six"")// Console Output:// a, one// b, two// manyMoreArgs, [""three"", ""four"", ""five"", ""six""]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Object Destructuring in JSconst user = {    id: 42,    is_verified: true};const {id, is_verified} = user;// here the name of variable should be same as the object's keysconsole.log(id); // 42console.log(is_verified); // true    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Since the variable names should match the object's key, JS allows using aliases:const o = {p: 42, q: true};const {p: foo, q: bar} = o;console.log(foo); // 42 console.log(bar); // true    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Destructuring of argument passed as Objectconst info = {    name: ""Sachin"",    age: 21,    profession: ""Software Engineer""}function printDetails({name, age = 18, profession: job}) {    console.log('name', name)    console.log('age', age)    console.log('job', job)}printDetails(info)// name Sachin// age 21// job Software Engineer// default age 18// job as alias to profession    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    With so many rules with quite some similarities and subtle differences, remembering all these can seem to be overwhelming at first. I suggest not to mug up these syntax if you use either Python or JS or both, you can always bookmark this and read it later as and when you need to look up for something.
