Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebastián Ramírez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#290 Side Hustles for Data Scientists,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/290/side-hustles-for-data-scientists,"Are you a data scientist looking to branch out on your own and start something new? Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job, and hoping things work out, maybe you should start with a side-hustle. On this episode, you'll meet Keith McCormick, a data scientist who has many irons in the fire and he's here to tell us about different types of side hustles and why you may want to try or avoid one.Links from the showKeith on Twitter: @kmccormickblogKeith on LinkedIn: linkedin.comKeith's courses: linkedin.comSide Hustle Strategies for Data Science and Analytics Experts course: linkedin.com/learningTalk Python's Excel to Python course: talkpython.fm/excelSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-11-13T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#304 asyncio all the things with Omnilib,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/304/asyncio-all-the-things-with-omnilib,"The relatively recent introduction of async and await as keywords in Python have spawned a whole area of high performance, highly scalable frameworks and supporting libraries. One such library that has great async building blocks is Omnilib. On this episode, you'll meet John Reese. John is the creator of Omnilib, which includes packages such as aioitertools, aiomultiprocess, and aiosqlite.

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#287 Testing without dependencies, mocking in Python",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/287/testing-without-dependencies-mocking-in-python,"We know our unit tests should be relatively independent from other parts of the system. For example, running a test shouldn't generally call a credit card possessing API and talk to a database when your goal is just to test the argument validation. And yet, your method does all three of those and more. What do you do? Some languages use elaborate dependency passing frameworks that go under the banner of inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injections (DI). In Python, the most common fix is to temporarily redefine what those two functions do using patching and mocking.On this episode, we welcome back Anna-Lena Pokes to talk us through the whole spectrum of test doubles, dummies, mocks, and more.Links from the showAnna-Lena's personal site: alpopkes.com100 Days of Code episode: talkpython.fm/186Anna-Lena on Github: github.comPyCon talk from Lisa Road (2018) - “Demystifying the patch function”: youtube.comPyCon talk from Edwin Jung (2019) - Mocking and Patching Pitfalls: youtube.comKeynote talk “Finding Magic in Python” (about magical universeproject): youtube.comBlog post about mocking in Python: alpopkes.comStackoverflow post on difference between stubs and mocks: stackoverflow.comFreezegun project: github.comKI Macht Schule (AI goes to school): ki-macht-schule.deCode Combat: codecombat.comPDB++: github.comSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
