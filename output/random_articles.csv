Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#273 CoCalc: A fully colloborative notebook development environment,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/273/cocalc-a-fully-colloborative-notebook-development-environment,"Everyone in the Python space is familiar with Notebooks these days. One of the original notebook environments was SageMath. Created by William Stein, and collaborators, it began as an open-source, Python-based, computational environment focused on mathematicians. It has since grown into a full-blown company and has become a proper collaborative environment for things like Jupyter notebooks, Linux-backed Bash shells, and much more. Think Google Docs but across all these facets of development in your browser.We welcome back William Stein to give us an update on his journey from professor to entrepreneur building CoCalc along the way.Links from the showWilliam on Twitter: @wstein389CoCalc: cocalc.comEpisode 59 about SageMath: talkpython.fm/59Comparing CoCalc to other products: cocalc.comExamples/Gallery: share.cocalc.comSageMath: sagemath.orgX11 server: xpra.orgSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-18T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#291 Operational Resilience with Pyomo,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/291/operational-resilience-with-pyomo,"Do you have a scientific system that needs optimization or solving? Our guest, on this episode, Clark Petri is here to tell us all about pyomo. This is a library that can solve all sorts of cool problems, linear programming, nonlinear equations, and many other things you can throw at it.  We're gonna solve a really fun diet problem: What is the most nutritious meal that you can eat for the least amount of money? The answer might surprise you a little bit! It's going to be a lot of fun. So listen in to hear about how Clark has used pyomo to do his work and how you might use it in yours.Links from the showPyomo: pyomo.orgClark on Twitter: @clarkpetriCenter for Infrastructure Defense: nps.eduThesis: apps.dtic.milI’m not alone in my work post: morenuance.comhandcalcs package: github.comDiet optimization problem: nbviewer.jupyter.orgTalk Python [Pro Edition]: talkpython.fm/proBlack Friday at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/blackfridaySponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-22T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

The team at Satori has a background in cybersecurity and they are using the lessons that they learned in that field to address the challenge of access control and auditing for data governance. In this episode co-founder and CTO Yoav Cohen explains how the Satori platform provides a proxy layer for your data, the challenges of managing security across disparate storage systems, and their approach to building a dynamic data catalog based on the records that your organization is actually using. This is an interesting conversation about the intersection of data and security and the lessons that can be learned in each direction.",2020-12-28T22:19:17Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

With the growth in projects, platforms, and services that aim to help you establish and maintain control of the health and reliability of your data pipelines it can be overwhelming to stay up to date with how they all compare. In this episode Egor Gryaznov, CTO of Bigeye, joins the show to explore the landscape of data quality companies, the general strategies that they are using, and what problems they solve. He also shares how his own product is designed and the challenges that are involved in building a system to help data engineers manage the complexity of a data platform. If you are wondering how to get better control of your own pipelines and the traps to avoid then this episode is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-23T23:26:25Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
