Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#269 HoloViz - a suite of tools for Python visualization,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/269/holoviz-a-suite-of-tools-for-python-visualization,"The toolchain for modern data science can be intimidating. How do you choose between all the data visualization libraries out there? How about creating interactive web apps from those analyses? On this episode, we dive into a project that attempts to bring the whole story together: HoloViz.  HoloViz is a coordinated effort to make browser-based data visualization in Python easier to use, easier to learn, and more powerful. And we have Philipp Rudiger from HoloViz here to guide us through it.Links from the showPhilipp on Twitter: @PhilippJFRHoloViews on Twitter: @HoloViewsPanel on Twitter: @Panel_orgDatashader on Twitter: @datashaderExamples: examples.pyviz.orgHoloViz tutorial: holoviz.orgPanel website: panel.holoviz.orgHoloViews website: holoviews.orgGeoViews website: geoviews.orgProject Discourse: discourse.holoviz.orgPyData Berlin talk: youtube.comCensus example: examples.pyviz.org/...SponsorsBrilliantDatadogTalk Python Training",2020-06-19T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Yet, the core will be the same throughout. I think this is a cool lesson to learn as you get deeper into programming and a great story to highlight it. We are going to meet Ravin Kumar who wrote Python code and data science tooling for oil rig tool manufacturer, a rocket company, and a hip multilocation restaurant chain.Links from the showRavin on Twitter: @canyon289PyMC3: pymc.ioArviz project: arviz-devs.github.io/arvizpystan project: pystan.readthedocs.ioNumFocus: numfocus.orgBayesian Decision Making: canyon289.github.ioopen-aerospace project: open-aerospace.github.ioSweetGreen: sweetgreen.comGet notified when Bayesian Computation In Python is out: docs.google.com/formsBayesian Analysis with Python Book: packtpub.comSponsorsSentry Error Monitoring, Code TALKPYTHONLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-06-25T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebastián Ramírez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

You can visualize the APIs with the smooth scalability taking to the mobile apps. You can see how, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime. What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form and integrating mail capabilities just for this purpose. Or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.Don't worry, we got you covered.
