Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#279 Modern Python Developer's Toolkit,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/279/modern-python-developers-toolkit,"Python is quick and easy to learn. And yet, there is a massive gap between knowing the common aspects of the language (loops, variables, functions, and so on) and how to write a well-factored application using modern tools and libraries. That's where learning Python is a never-ending journey. Sebastian Witowski is here to give us his take on a modern Python developer's toolkit. There are a bunch of great tips in store for us.Links from the showSebastian on Twitter: @SebaWitowskiThe tutorial recording from PyCon: youtube.comSebastian’s website: switowski.comWorkshop resources site: pycon.switowski.comWriting Faster Python talk: youtube.comHugo Static Site Theme: gohugo.ioAnnouncements at Talk PythonPython Memory Course: talkpython.fm/memExcel to Python and Pandas Course: talkpython.fm/excelExcel to Python Webcast: talkpython.fm/excel-webcastTeam Cohorts: talkpython.fm/cohortsSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-29T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#271 Unlock the mysteries of time, Python's datetime that is!",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/271/unlock-the-mysteries-of-time-pythons-datetime-that-is,"Time is a simple thing, right? And working with it in Python is great. You just import datetime and then (somewhat oddly) use the datetime class from that module.  Oh except, there are times with timezones, and times without. And why is there a total_seconds() but not total_minutes(), hours() or days() on timedelta? How about computing the number of weeks? What if you wanted to iterate over the next 22 workdays, skipping weekends?Ok, we'd better talk about time in Python! Good thing Paul Ganssle is here.

You can visualize the APIs with the smooth scalability taking to the mobile apps. You can see how, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime. What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form and integrating mail capabilities just for this purpose. Or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.Don't worry, we got you covered.
