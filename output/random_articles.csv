Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#285 Dask as a Platform Service with Coiled,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/285/dask-as-a-platform-service-with-coiled,"If you're into data science, you've probably heard about Dask. It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters. While powerful, this may take some serious setup to execute in its full glory. That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson and others to launch a business to help Python loving data scientists run Dask workloads in the cloud. And they are here to tell us about they open-source foundation business.And they must be on to something, between recording and releasing this episode, they raised $5M in VC funding.Links from the showHugo on Twitter: @hugobowneMatthew on Twitter: @mrocklinCoiled: coiled.ioCoiled raised $5M in Sept: twitter.comA brief history of dask article: coiled.io/blogCoiled: Dask for Everyone, Everywhere: medium.comThe incredible growth of python: stackoverflow.blogGrowth updated (SO Trends current): insights.stackoverflow.comCoiled Youtube channel: youtube.comSnorkel package: pypi.orgSponsorsBrilliantMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-09T07:00:00Z,podcasts

Yet, the core will be the same throughout. I think this is a cool lesson to learn as you get deeper into programming and a great story to highlight it. We are going to meet Ravin Kumar who wrote Python code and data science tooling for oil rig tool manufacturer, a rocket company, and a hip multilocation restaurant chain.Links from the showRavin on Twitter: @canyon289PyMC3: pymc.ioArviz project: arviz-devs.github.io/arvizpystan project: pystan.readthedocs.ioNumFocus: numfocus.orgBayesian Decision Making: canyon289.github.ioopen-aerospace project: open-aerospace.github.ioSweetGreen: sweetgreen.comGet notified when Bayesian Computation In Python is out: docs.google.com/formsBayesian Analysis with Python Book: packtpub.comSponsorsSentry Error Monitoring, Code TALKPYTHONLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-06-25T07:00:00Z,podcasts
