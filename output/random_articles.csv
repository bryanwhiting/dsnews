Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Streaming Data Integration Without The Code at Equalum - Episode 161,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/equalum-streaming-data-integration-episode-161/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The first stage of every good pipeline is to perform data integration. With the increasing pace of change and the need for up to date analytics the need to integrate that data in near real time is growing. With the improvements and increased variety of options for streaming data engines and improved tools for change data capture it is possible for data teams to make that goal a reality. However, despite all of the tools and managed distributions of those streaming engines it is still a challenge to build a robust and reliable pipeline for streaming data integration, especially if you need to expose those capabilities to non-engineers. In this episode Ido Friedman, CTO of Equalum, explains how they have built a no-code platform to make integration of streaming data and change data capture feeds easier to manage. He discusses the challenges that are inherent in the current state of CDC technologies, how they have architected their system to integrate well with existing data platforms, and how to build an appropriate level of abstraction for such a complex problem domain. If you are struggling with streaming data integration and change data capture then this interview is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-30T23:36:49Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Do You Actually Know What A String In JavaScript Is? Here's What I Found.,https://dev.to/nickbulljs/do-you-actually-know-what-string-in-javascript-is-here-s-what-i-found-23l7,"We preferred to think that String in JavaScript is an array of characters.const name = ‘Nick’console.log(name.length) // 4    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Variable name has 4 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’ and length is also 4.Everything seems logical.Let’s go further and add emoji to my name.const name = ‘Nick 🐃’console.log(name.length) // 7    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Hmm, strange.Variable name must have 6 characters ‘N’, ‘i’, ‘c’, ‘k’, ‘ ‘ (whitespace) and ‘🐃’But have 7.It seems like the bull has 2 characters.const emoji = ‘🐃’console.log(emoji.length) // 2    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Interesting 🤔Let’s figure out why.We go to the official documentation of ECMAScript (it’s a programming language on which JavaScript is based).Scroll to “6.1.4 The String Type.”And find this:“The String type is the set of all ordered sequences of zero or more 16-bit unsigned integer values (“elements”) up to a maximum length of 2⁵³ - 1 elements. The String type is generally used to represent textual data in a running ECMAScript program, in which case each element in the String is treated as a UTF-16 code unit value.”So string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values.❓What is UTF-16?💬 A Unicode transformation format (UTF) is an algorithmic mapping from every Unicode code point to a unique byte sequence.One UTF-16 code unit value is a number from 0x0000 to 0xFFFF.❓What is 0x0000 and 0xFFFF?💬  0x represent the hexadecimal numeral system, often shortened to ""hex"", is a numeral system made up of 16 symbols (base 16). The standard numeral system is called decimal (base 10) and uses ten symbols: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Hexadecimal uses the decimal numbers and six extra symbols.If we convert my name Nick to UTF-16 (like JavaScript see it) we will get 0x004e 0x0069 0x0063 0x006b.0x004e = N0x0069 = i0x0063 = c0x006b = kBut how does JavaScript treat emojis?In UTF-16, Unicode characters from the Basic Multilingual Plane (contains characters for almost all modern languages) are encoded with one code unit. Other characters from the non-Basic Multilingual Plane (emojis, musical notations, cards, hieroglyphs, etc) require two code units.So UTF-16 format represents 🐃 emoji with two code units (0Xd83d 0Xdc03).That’s why ‘🐃’.length gives 2.To consolidate everything we have learned, let’s play a little with Unicode and JavaScript.const name = ‘Nick’const nameInUnicode = ‘\u004e\u0069\u0063\u006b’console.log(name === nameInUnicode) // trueconsole.log(nameInUnicode.length) // 4const fullName = ‘Nick 🐃’const fullNameInUnicode = ‘\u004e\u0069\u0063\u006b\u0020\ud83d\udc03’console.log(fullName === fullNameInUnicode) // trueconsole.log(fullNameInUnicode.length) // 7    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    ❓ What is \u?💬 A Unicode character escape sequence represents the single Unicode code point formed by the hexadecimal number following the “\u” or “\U” characters.      In the endKnowing that string in JavaScript is a sequence of UTF-16 code unit values can save you from unpredictable bugs when you work with different characters not from BMP, like emojis.If you like this article, share it with your friends and follow me on Twitter.Also, every week I send out a ""3–2–1"" newsletter with 3 tech news, 2 articles, and 1 piece of advice for you.📌 Subscribe to my 3–2–1 newsletter here 📌",2020-12-01T11:45:41Z,#datascience #tutorials

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Software Developer or Software Artist?,https://dev.to/bethwilliamson/software-developer-or-software-artist-2m4g,"I was an artist in the conventional sense. I have spent the last 7 years creating conceptual art pieces were the outcomes have been traditional art objects; photographs, cyanotypes, video installations and sculpture. Sure, I was pushing convention within my practice of photography by presenting an outcome as a plaster sculpture, but I was really only deviating in my result.More recently I have started to deviate in my process. Trading the click of a camera shutter for the clattering of keys on a keyboard. Swapping the photographic studio and all of its tripods, lights and black out curtains for a computer screen, a digital workspace, one environment that hosts all of its tools and equipment digitally. At first I felt out of my depth. Art is accessible because we don’t need instructions on how to access and use its materials. It is tacit. It is freeing. Programming felt so inaccessible. The idea of having to learn a new language before you could even start felt terrifying.Then I realised the programming language exists so that it is accessible. One system that transcends language and culture and is accessible to everyone.       Isn’t it restrictive?When I was in the tutorial phase of my journey, I couldn’t help but think, boy this is restrictive! I thought maybe it was because I was from an art background and was lucky to not have to adhere to many rules, but mostly, I thought it was because it was all of an artist’s trigger words;ComputersScienceMathAs it turns out, it is freeing. Its potential is infinite and once you learn the language and syntax you can create anything.There is beauty and creativity in every aspect, in thinking of a concept, in the process of writing it, in the creative problem solving and clean-up of the code, and undeniably, in the outcome.In many ways it is even less restrictive than art; the community embraces collaboration and shares code dispelling most problems about authorship and originality. It is totally scalable, it can be live, interactive or pre-made, it can be different every time it is ran, it can be imitative or abstract, it can be responsive to embedded information or live features and it can display 16,777,216 colours.  How can something so malleable be restrictive? There is freedom in navigating the structures of a system.       ""But the programmer isn’t a real artist because they don’t have real creative freedom!""I could not disagree more. Every piece of code totally reflects the author of it, much like a novel does. The programmer’s code is absolutely a declaration of themselves.Also, much like a novel, it does not need to be shared, seen, or experienced in order for it to achieve the status of art. It is art because it is art. Art is about executing a concept out of the materiality of your practice, but overall it is about creating. That’s why computer programmers are artists.",2020-12-01T11:38:27Z,#datascience #tutorials
