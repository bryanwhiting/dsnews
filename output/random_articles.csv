On this episode, we have Dr. Becky Smethurst who's an astrophysicist at Oxford University. She uses Python to explore galaxies and black holes. Learn how she's using Python to make new discoveries at the cutting edge of research and dive into a couple of her YouTube videos aimed at spreading scientific truth in an entertaining wrapper.Links from the showDr. Becky on Twitter: @drbecky_Dr. Becky's YouTube channel: youtube.com5 ways I use code as an astrophysicist video: youtube.comAstrophysicist reacts to funny space MEMES video: youtube.comA day in the life of an Oxford University Astrophysicist: youtube.comBook: Space: 10 things you should know: amazon.comSpaceMemesApple maps: imageOtter space: imageEclipses: imageSteals a cow: imageBlack holes: imageYouTube live stream: youtube.comSponsorsLinodeCloudEnvTalk Python Training",2021-02-12T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Leave Your Data Where It Is And Automate Feature Extraction With Molecula - Episode 175,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/molecula-feature-store-episode-175/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"A majority of the time spent in data engineering is copying data between systems to make the information available for different purposes. This introduces challenges such as keeping information synchronized, managing schema evolution, building transformations to match the expectations of the destination systems. H.O. Maycotte was faced with these same challenges but at a massive scale, leading him to question if there is a better way. After tasking some of his top engineers to consider the problem in a new light they created the Pilosa engine. In this episode H.O. explains how using Pilosa as the core he built the Molecula platform to eliminate the need to copy data between systems in able to make it accessible for analytical and machine learning purposes. He also discusses the challenges that he faces in helping potential users and customers understand the shift in thinking that this creates, and how the system is architected to make it possible. This is a fascinating conversation about what the future looks like when you revisit your assumptions about how systems are designed.",2021-03-09T00:32:48Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#296 Python in F1 racing,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/296/python-in-f1-racing,"Quick: Name the 3 most advanced engineering organizations you can think of? Maybe an aerospace company such as SpaceX or Boeing come to mind. Maybe you thought of CERN and the LHC. But in terms of bespoke engineering capabilities, you should certainly put the F1 racing teams on your list. These organizations appear as 20-30 people on a race day shown on TV. But in fact, the number of people back at the home base doing the engineering work can be over 500 employees. Almost every tiny part you see on these cars as well as the tools to maintain them are custom-built.The engineering problems solved are immense. Would it surprise you to know that Python is playing a major role here? On this episode, you'll meet Joe Borg who help pioneer Python's adoption at several F1 teams.Links from the showJoe's website: josephb.orgJoe on Twitter: @joedborgRacing Point F1 team: racingpointf1.comScuderia Alpha Tauri F1 team: scuderiaalphatauri.comMicroK8s: microk8s.ioCharmed Kubernetes: ubuntu.com/kubernetesSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-12-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,System Observability For The Cloud Native Era With Chronosphere - Episode 170,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/chronosphere-metrics-observability-episode-170/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Collecting and processing metrics for monitoring use cases is an interesting data problem. It is eminently possible to generate millions or billions of data points per second, the information needs to be propagated to a central location, processed, and analyzed in timeframes on the order of milliseconds or single-digit seconds, and the consumers of the data need to be able to query the information quickly and flexibly. As the systems that we build continue to grow in scale and complexity the need for reliable and manageable monitoring platforms increases proportionately. In this episode Rob Skillington, CTO of Chronosphere, shares his experiences building metrics systems that provide observability to companies that are operating at extreme scale. He describes how the M3DB storage engine is designed to manage the pressures of a critical system component, the inherent complexities of working with telemetry data, and the motivating factors that are contributing to the growing need for flexibility in querying the collected metrics. This is a fascinating conversation about an area of data management that is often taken for granted.",2021-02-02T02:59:59Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
DEV Community,https://dev.to,How to create a Skip Navigation link,https://dev.to/savvasstephnds/how-to-create-a-skip-navigation-link-5e56,"AboutWhen navigating a website with a keyboard, it's often that you'll have to tab through the website's navigation header before getting to the main content. It gets especially frustrating when you get through loads of pages to get where you want. In this tutorial, I will walk you through creating a ""Skip Navigation"" link so that your keyboard users can easily avoid tabbing through the navigation and get straight to the main content.      What are we building?What we are creating here is basically a link that is invisible while browsing the website but becomes visible once it gains focus when the user navigates the site with the Tab key.      Why?Before we move on to the tutorial let's answer the common question: Why do I need to make my site fully accessible with a keyboard?Some users rely on the keyboard for navigating the web. Users with motor disabilities often find it difficult to navigate with a mouse or any other device. We therefore need to make sure that our website is 100% accessible with a keyboard.This article from WebAIM does a better job at explaining the importance of keyboard accessibility.      Setting up our websiteFirst things first, let's create the basic layout of our website. The end result will look something like this:It'll be a basic home page with:A &lt;header&gt; which contains &lt;nav&gt; which contains the navigation elements in a &lt;ul&gt;A &lt;main&gt; section which contains the main section of our website, with some dummy ""lorem ipsum"" text      HTML&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html lang=""en""&gt;&lt;head&gt;    &lt;meta charset=""UTF-8""&gt;    &lt;meta http-equiv=""X-UA-Compatible"" content=""IE=edge""&gt;    &lt;meta name=""viewport"" content=""width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0""&gt;    &lt;title&gt;Document&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""style.css""&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;    &lt;header&gt;        &lt;nav&gt;            &lt;ul&gt;                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#"" id=""site-name""&gt;MySite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;About&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;Projects&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;                &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;Contact&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;            &lt;/ul&gt;        &lt;/nav&gt;    &lt;/header&gt;    &lt;main&gt;        &lt;article&gt;            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""#""&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor&lt;/a&gt; sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

For this we need to do 2 things:Make our &lt;main&gt; tag an anchor so we can navigate to it easilyCreate a link which takes the user to the main sectionHide it with CSSUse CSS to make the link visible on focus      1. Make our &lt;main&gt; tag an anchorTo do this all we need to do is give an ID to our &lt;main&gt; tag. Let's call it main-part:- &lt;main&gt;+ &lt;main id=""main-part""&gt;      2. Create the linkNow we need to create our ""Skip navigation"" link right under our &lt;body&gt; tag and right before the &lt;header&gt; tag:&lt;body&gt;+    &lt;a href=""#main-part"" id=""skip-navigation""&gt;Skip navigation&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;header&gt;      3. Make it invisibleNow we need to hide it from the user. We do that with CSS:#skip-navigation{    position: fixed;    top: -100%;    left: 0;    background-color: #903749;    color: white;    text-decoration: none;    padding: 18px;    border: 3px solid #e84545;}Notice the position: fixed and top: -100% lines. These are the lines that make the link invisible.      4. Make it visible on :focusLastly, we set the top parameter of the link when it has the focus:#skip-navigation:focus{    top: 0;}And that's it! As soon as you open the page and press the Tab button, the Skip Navigation button should show up. Pressing the Enter key should take you straight to the main content!See live demo      ConclusionHas this tutorial been helpful?
