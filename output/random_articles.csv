Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#289 Discovering exoplanets with Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/289/discovering-exoplanets-with-python,"When I saw the headline ""Machine learning algorithm confirms 50 new exoplanets in historic first"" I knew the Python angle of this story had to be told! And that's how this episode was born. Join David Armstrong and Jev Gamper as they tell us how they use Python and machine learning to discover not 1, but 50 new exoplanets in pre-existing Keplar satellite data.Links from the showJev Gamper on Twitter: @brutforcimagMachine learning algorithm confirms 50 new exoplanets in historic first article: techrepublic.comSponsorsBrilliantTalk Python Training",2020-11-09T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

But that doesn't make it a good fit for every data processing need. And when you outgrow Excel, a really good option for a next step is Python and the data science tech stack: Pandas, Jupyter, and friends. Chris Moffitt is back on Talk Python to give us concrete tips and tricks for moving from Excel to Python!Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chris1610Practical Business Python: pbpython.comEscaping Excel Hell with Python and Pandas Episode 200: talkpython.fmSideTable package: pbpython.comLearn more and go deeperMove from Excel to Python with Pandas Course: training.talkpython.fmExcel to Python webcast: crowdcast.ioSponsorsVoyager gameLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-31T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#291 Operational Resilience with Pyomo,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/291/operational-resilience-with-pyomo,"Do you have a scientific system that needs optimization or solving? Our guest, on this episode, Clark Petri is here to tell us all about pyomo. This is a library that can solve all sorts of cool problems, linear programming, nonlinear equations, and many other things you can throw at it.  We're gonna solve a really fun diet problem: What is the most nutritious meal that you can eat for the least amount of money? The answer might surprise you a little bit! It's going to be a lot of fun. So listen in to hear about how Clark has used pyomo to do his work and how you might use it in yours.Links from the showPyomo: pyomo.orgClark on Twitter: @clarkpetriCenter for Infrastructure Defense: nps.eduThesis: apps.dtic.milI’m not alone in my work post: morenuance.comhandcalcs package: github.comDiet optimization problem: nbviewer.jupyter.orgTalk Python [Pro Edition]: talkpython.fm/proBlack Friday at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/blackfridaySponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-22T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
