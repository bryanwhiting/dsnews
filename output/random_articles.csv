Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Leave Your Data Where It Is And Automate Feature Extraction With Molecula - Episode 175,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/molecula-feature-store-episode-175/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"A majority of the time spent in data engineering is copying data between systems to make the information available for different purposes. This introduces challenges such as keeping information synchronized, managing schema evolution, building transformations to match the expectations of the destination systems. H.O. Maycotte was faced with these same challenges but at a massive scale, leading him to question if there is a better way. After tasking some of his top engineers to consider the problem in a new light they created the Pilosa engine. In this episode H.O. explains how using Pilosa as the core he built the Molecula platform to eliminate the need to copy data between systems in able to make it accessible for analytical and machine learning purposes. He also discusses the challenges that he faces in helping potential users and customers understand the shift in thinking that this creates, and how the system is architected to make it possible. This is a fascinating conversation about what the future looks like when you revisit your assumptions about how systems are designed.",2021-03-09T00:32:48Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#286 Python and ML at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/286/python-and-ml-at-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-jpl,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field. And he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chrismattmannChris at JPL: jpl.nasa.govNature: A vision for data science: nature.comOpen source at JPL: github.comApache Nutch: nutch.apache.org7 Minutes of Terror: The Challenges of Getting to Mars: youtube.comtqdm package: pypi.orgPanama Papers: wikipedia.orgSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-16T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Making v-model Model Value Optional in Vue.js,https://dev.to/alexgrozav/making-v-model-model-value-optional-in-vue-js-59jj,"While writing my Vue.js UI Library, Inkline, I had to find a way to make some components work both with and without providing a model value (v-model). While it's not a common scenario, it's something that you'll definitely come across if you're writing a library and you're serious about Developer Experience (DX).I call them Optionally Controlled Components, because they're supposed to work out of the box without providing a v-model, but will give you complete control over their state if you do provide a v-model.      The Menu ExampleOne prime example of an Optionally Controlled Component would be a menu that can be opened (expanded) or closed (collapsed). Let's call the component simply MyMenu. From a Developer Experience perspective, you'll probably want your library user to be able to drop a &lt;my-menu&gt; into their code and start adding collapsible content right away, without having to worry about handling its open or closed state. Here's what the component would look like without v-model support:&lt;template&gt;    &lt;div class=""my-menu""&gt;        &lt;button @click=""toggleMenu""&gt;            Menu        &lt;/button&gt;        &lt;menu v-show=""open""&gt;            &lt;slot /&gt;        &lt;/menu&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default {    name: 'MyMenu',    data() {        return {            open: false        };    },    methods: {        toggleMenu() {            this.open = !this.open;        }    }}&lt;/script&gt;      The Optional Model ValueSo far so good. Let's consider the following scenario: your user wants to be able to open or close the menu from somewhere else. We know we can open and close the menu internally at this point, but how do we allow the library user to optionally control the state? There's a future-proof solution I found, that will save you a lot of trouble. Here's what it looks like:&lt;template&gt;    &lt;div class=""my-menu""&gt;        &lt;button @click=""toggleMenu""&gt;            Menu        &lt;/button&gt;        &lt;menu v-show=""open""&gt;            &lt;slot /&gt;        &lt;/menu&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/template&gt;&lt;script&gt;export default {    name: 'MyMenu',    emits: [        'update:modelValue'    ],    props: {        modelValue: {            type: Boolean,            default: false        }    },    data() {        return {            open: this.modelValue        };    },    methods: {        toggleMenu() {            this.open = !this.open;            this.$emit('update:modelValue', this.open);        }    },    watch: {        modelValue(value) {            this.open = value;        }    }}&lt;/script&gt;Try a basic example out live on CodeSandbox.You can see above that I've added the usual modelValue prop to provide v-model support in Vue 3, but mainly I've done three things: I'm setting the initial value of our internal open state property to be equal to the one provided via v-model. This works wonders, because when there's no v-model it would be equal to the specified default, false in our case. I'm emitting an update:modelValue event every time I change the value of this.open internallyI've added a watcher that ensures I'm always keeping the internal open value in sync with the incoming external modelValue prop.      ConclusionAwesome, isn't it? It's important to never forget about Developer Experience. Something as small as this can add up to precious hours of saved development time if done correctly and consistently. I hope you learned something interesting today. I'd love to hear how the Optionally Controlled Components pattern helped you out, so feel free to reach out to me. Happy coding!P.S. Have you heard that Inkline 3 is coming with Vue 3 support?
