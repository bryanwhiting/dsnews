Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,How to use formik with useFormik prop in react,https://dev.to/aneeqakhan/how-to-use-formik-with-useformik-prop-in-react-2k6d,"Formik is a super cool library and I use it every time. So today I am writing this post for beginners and it covers the use of formik on the simple login form. I'll cover these things hereCreate and style a basic login formInitialize formik default statesApply validation on login fieldsWrite submit form function      Create and style a login form I created login form like this      &lt;form className=""form""&gt;        &lt;div className=""field""&gt;          &lt;label htmlFor=""email""&gt;Email Address&lt;/label&gt;          &lt;input            id=""email""            name=""email""            type=""email""          /&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;div className=""field""&gt;          &lt;label htmlFor=""password""&gt;Password&lt;/label&gt;          &lt;input            id=""password""            name=""password""            type=""password""          /&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;button type=""submit"" className=""submit-btn""&gt;          Login        &lt;/button&gt;      &lt;/form&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    and styled it like this.form {  width: 300px;  display: flex;  flex-direction: column;  margin-top: 50px;  background-color: #ddd;  border-radius: 8px;  padding: 10px;}.field {  display: flex;  justify-content: space-between;  padding-bottom: 10px;}.submit-btn {  align-self: flex-end;  width: 80px;}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    After this, you'll get a login form same as this      Initialize formik default states Lets import the useFormik first from the formikimport { useFormik } from ""formik"";    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now you can create a formik object using useFormik hook and define your initialValues in it  const formik = useFormik({    initialValues: {      email: """",      password: """"    }  });    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    let's use the formik handleChange function and pass formik values to our input fields     ...          &lt;input            id=""email""            name=""email""            type=""email""            onChange={formik.handleChange}            onBlur={formik.handleBlur}            value={formik.values.email}          /&gt;     ...          &lt;input            id=""password""            name=""password""            type=""password""            onChange={formik.handleChange}            onBlur={formik.handleBlur}            value={formik.values.password}          /&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Apply validations on login fields I used Yup library to apply validations on my fields. You can use custom regex as well if you don't want to use Yup for some reason.So first import Yup like thisimport * as Yup from ""yup"";    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then I added validationSchema for my login fields const formik = useFormik({    initialValues: {      email: """",      password: """"    },    validationSchema: Yup.object().shape({      email: Yup.string()        .email(""Invalid email address"")        .required(""Please enter email""),      password: Yup.string().required(""Please enter password"")    }),  });    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Here Yup is validating if the values of the field are provided; if yes, then is it correct format or not.So if any error happens according to our validation schema, it will be stored in formik's errors object and we can print it beside or below the field like this     {formik.touched.email &amp;&amp; formik.errors.email ? (         &lt;span className=""error""&gt;{formik.errors.email}&lt;/span&gt;     ) : null}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now our form looks like this with validation errors      Write submit form function The last step is to create submit function and perform your operation on formik values. You can navigate to the next screen, call API, or anything you want to do. I just set a state on submit and shown a message to a user on the login  const formik = useFormik({    initialValues: {      email: """",      password: """"    },    validationSchema: Yup.object().shape({      email: Yup.string()        .email(""Invalid email address"")        .required(""Please enter email""),      password: Yup.string().required(""Please enter password"")    }),    onSubmit: (values) =&gt; {      setIsLoggedIn(true);    }  });    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    and pass formik handleSubmit function to your form like this&lt;form className=""form"" onSubmit={formik.handleSubmit}&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    and here your form is ready with field validations!!You can find the full source code here",2021-01-28T16:06:16Z,#datascience #tutorials
