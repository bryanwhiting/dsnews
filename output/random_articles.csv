Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Using Your Data Warehouse As The Source Of Truth For Customer Data With Hightouch - Episode 168,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/hightouch-customer-data-warehouse-episode-168/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The data warehouse has become the central component of the modern data stack. Building on this pattern, the team at Hightouch have created a platform that synchronizes information about your customers out to third party systems for use by marketing and sales teams. In this episode Tejas Manohar explains the benefits of sourcing customer data from one location for all of your organization to use, the technical challenges of synchronizing the data to external systems with varying APIs, and the workflow for enabling self-service access to your customer data by your marketing teams. This is an interesting conversation about the importance of the data warehouse and how it can be used beyond just internal analytics.",2021-01-19T02:16:10Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#299 Personal search engine with datasette and dogsheep,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/299/personal-search-engine-with-datasette-and-dogsheep,"In this episode, we'll be discussing two powerful tools for data reporting and exploration: Datasette and Dogsheep.Datasette helps people take data of any shape or size, analyze and explore it, and publish it as an interactive website and accompanying API.Dogsheep is a collection of tools for personal analytics using SQLite and Datasette. Imagine a unified search engine for everything personal in your life such as twitter, photos, google docs, todoist, goodreads, and more, all in once place and outside of cloud companies.On this episode we talk with Simon Willison who created both of these projects. He's also one of the co-creators of Django and we'll discuss some early Django history!Links from the showDatasette: datasette.ioDogsheep: dogsheep.github.ioDatasheet newsletter: datasette.substack.comVideo: Build your own data warehouse for personal analytics with SQLite and Datasette: youtube.comExamplesList: github.comPersonal data warehouses: github.comGlobal power plants: datasettes.comSF data: datasettes.comFiveThirtyEight: fivethirtyeight.datasettes.comLahman’s Baseball Database: baseballdb.lawlesst.netLive demo of current main: datasette.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2021-01-17T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

For each new source that they need to integrate with it is another custom set of ETL tasks that they need to maintain. In order to reduce the friction involved in supporting new data transformations David Molot and Hassan Syyid built the Hotlue platform. In this episode they describe the data integration challenges facing many B2B companies, how their work on the Hotglue platform simplifies their efforts, and how they have designed the platform to make these ETL workloads embeddable and self service for end users.",2021-01-26T02:05:21Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
