Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Building The Foundations For Data Driven Businesses at 5xData - Episode 172,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/5xdata-data-driven-foundations-episode-172/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Every business aims to be data driven, but not all of them succeed in that effort. In order to be able to truly derive insights from the data that an organization collects, there are certain foundational capabilities that they need to have capacity for. In order to help more businesses build those foundations, Tarush Aggarwal created 5xData, offering collaborative workshops to assist in setting up the technical and organizational systems that are necessary to succeed. In this episode he shares his thoughts on the core elements that are necessary for every business to be data driven, how he is helping companies incorporate those capabilities into their structure, and the ongoing support that he is providing through a network of mastermind groups. This is a great conversation about the initial steps that every group should be thinking of as they start down the road to making data informed decisions.",2021-02-16T02:58:33Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#283 Web scraping, the 2020 edition",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/283/web-scraping-the-2020-edition,"Web scraping is pulling the HTML of a website down and parsing useful data out of it. The use-cases for this type of functionality are endless. Have a bunch of data on governmental sites that are only listed online in HTML without a download? There's an API for that! Do you want to keep abreast of what your competitors are featuring on their site? There's an API for that. Need alerts for changes on a website, for example enrollment is now open at your college and you want to be first to get in and avoid the 8am Monday morning course slot? There's an API for that. That API is screen scraping and Attila Tóth from ScrapingHub is here to tell us all about it.Links from the showAttila Tóth on LinkedIn: linkedin.comScrapy project: scrapy.orgScrapinghub on Twitter: @scrapinghubScrapinghub: scrapinghub.comcookiecutter template for Scrapy projects: github.comSplash: headless browser designed specifically for web scraping: scrapinghub.com/splashAwesome Web Scraping list: github.comTalk Python episode 50 on web scraping: talkpython.fmHow Web Scraping is Revealing Lobbying and Corruption in Peru: blog.scrapinghub.comWeb Data Extraction Summit event: extractsummit.ioSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

This introduces challenges such as keeping information synchronized, managing schema evolution, building transformations to match the expectations of the destination systems. H.O. Maycotte was faced with these same challenges but at a massive scale, leading him to question if there is a better way. After tasking some of his top engineers to consider the problem in a new light they created the Pilosa engine. In this episode H.O. explains how using Pilosa as the core he built the Molecula platform to eliminate the need to copy data between systems in able to make it accessible for analytical and machine learning purposes. He also discusses the challenges that he faces in helping potential users and customers understand the shift in thinking that this creates, and how the system is architected to make it possible. This is a fascinating conversation about what the future looks like when you revisit your assumptions about how systems are designed.",2021-03-09T00:32:48Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
