Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#279 Modern Python Developer's Toolkit,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/279/modern-python-developers-toolkit,"Python is quick and easy to learn. And yet, there is a massive gap between knowing the common aspects of the language (loops, variables, functions, and so on) and how to write a well-factored application using modern tools and libraries. That's where learning Python is a never-ending journey. Sebastian Witowski is here to give us his take on a modern Python developer's toolkit. There are a bunch of great tips in store for us.Links from the showSebastian on Twitter: @SebaWitowskiThe tutorial recording from PyCon: youtube.comSebastian’s website: switowski.comWorkshop resources site: pycon.switowski.comWriting Faster Python talk: youtube.comHugo Static Site Theme: gohugo.ioAnnouncements at Talk PythonPython Memory Course: talkpython.fm/memExcel to Python and Pandas Course: talkpython.fm/excelExcel to Python Webcast: talkpython.fm/excel-webcastTeam Cohorts: talkpython.fm/cohortsSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-29T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,What I wish I knew before entering the field of programming,https://dev.to/sarayugautam/what-i-wish-i-knew-before-entering-the-field-of-programming-g8j,"No wonder programming is like any other gig, hobby, or passion. But as every field of interest has its individuality, programming has its own quirks. I have listed out three things that would have made my life as a beginner in programming a lot less difficult had I known it earlier.  Let's dive quickly into them.      Programming might not always be creativeOkay, I know I am going to get a lot of backlashes on this point because of what I am saying. All the thought processes, creative brainstorming, and multiple trials at the solution are not creative to solve a particular problem?No, they are. But most of the time there are already millions of people who tried to do the same thing, stuck at the same problem, and found appropriate answers. So, in the beginning, you won't know how to fix a particular warning/error caused by your vs code setting and you'll spend hours trying hours to solve but to no avail. At this point, instead of banging your head in the nearby wall, it is suggested, even recommended that you use google for finding out the solution to your problem.The downside to this is that over time you get so used to googling that you start looking up your browser for even the smallest of error caused by a missing semicolon. If you are not an algorithm developer, reinventing the wheel, or trying out an innovative idea/approach to solve a problem, you are surely going to browse through the Internet. So Programming might not always be a creative process as you think it might be.      Everything cannot be learned at the same timeLet me give you an example of writing. Writing fiction and writing technical articles are two different things. Though you can learn grammar, syntactical skills, vocabulary and formats of writing at the same time, it is hard to try writing in multiple genres simultaneously. The same goes for programming. This applies especially if you are a beginner and learning your basics. Yeah, it will be overwhelming knowing that you have to learn a lot to make your mark in the programming world, but allowing that to lead you to learn 4, 5, or more technical niches concurrently will make things not only worse but disastrous. And if those niches are not directly related to what you want to achieve, not being used in the project that you are doing, or not even remotely related to each other, it is sure to make you frustrated. Try to at least know the basics of the programming language, framework, library, architecture, whatever that you are learning before moving on to the next. Believe in lots of successful programmers who recommend the same thing.      Imposter syndrome is bound to occur at one point or anotherThis is a big field and hard to get established. If you are finding it tough to know what you love the most, you may try and master different things taking into heed the second point. Still, you'll take time to feel settled, accepting, and happy. Although you are great at data science and machine learning but do not have more in-depth knowledge on web development, you might forget what you know and feel stupid. You might even start to cruse yourself for not learning web development. If you are interested in backend development but suck at designing and frontend, you'll feel bad in a group of frontend geeks. Imposter syndrome is bound to occur as it is almost impossible to be a know-it-all. You'll have to be prepared for this. And when such a situation does occur, you need to be mindful not to wallow in self-hatred but to recognize your own potential. Another case where this syndrome will hunt you is when people assume you know all computers and geeky stuff just because you have good designing skills. You'll feel that you've been cheating on yourself and know nothing. But that's not true. You just choose to concentrate your time on designing to master it. It is something to be proud of rather than to feel bad for not learning all other things. It is okay not to be a jack of all trade but master of one.",2020-12-05T15:52:19Z,#datascience #tutorials

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Integrating MapBox with Next.js — the Cheaper Alternative to Google Maps,https://dev.to/niharikak101/integrating-mapbox-with-next-js-the-cheaper-alternative-to-google-maps-g39,"Lately, I’ve been working on creating an online platform for eco hotels and resorts, and found myself needing to render a map with some clickable marker pins (which we are going to reproduce in this tutorial). After scouring the internet with possible solutions, two immediate options sprung up — Google Maps and MapBox. While most of us are familiar with Google Maps because of the overwhelming presence it has in all our lives, integrating it in an application, I found, is less than ideal. Building a bootstrapped project, I wanted to keep the costs at a minimum and Google Map’s pricing structure would mean that the costs would begin to add up.      Enter MapBox!With a competitive pricing structure (the first 50,000 requests on web are free) and an easy-to-use and well documented API, MapBox is a good alternative to Google Maps. It is also built on top of OpenStreetMap, which is an open source mapping project. Win, win!      What are we building?We’re going to be querying MapBox’s search api to get some locations of an infamous coffee shop called Greggs, focusing our search on the Greater London region. Then, we are going to render these places in our MapBox &lt;Map&gt; component with a bunch of clickable markers. On click, these markers will display some dismissible popups.The finished product will look something like,      Let's Code!      Make a MapBox account to get your access tokenThe first thing you will need to do is to make a MapBox account so that you can get an access token. We will use this token to make requests to the various MapBox APIs.Once you have your access token, it is time to set up your very own Next.js project and integrate all the juicy functionality that MapBox provides.      Setup a new Next.js project (Skip this if you already have a project of your own)Setting up a Next.js project is straightforward, you can either follow the instructions laid out in the official documentation or run the following command to set up a new Next.js project (Make sure you have Node.js installed).npx create-next-app mapbox-project    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Then, cd into the mapbox-project directory and run the development server by running npm run dev or yarn dev . Et Voila! Your Next.js project is up and running!      Setup A MapBox MapNext up, it’s time to render a MapBox map in our project. We do this by adding a MapBox library written by the team at Uber called react-map-gl. This contains a suite of React components for MapBox. Add this library to your project by running:yarn add react-mapbox-gl    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    With this, we’re going to create a Map component which will live in components/Map.js.Create your Map.js file and add the following code to it:import { useState } from ""react"";import ReactMapGL from ""react-map-gl"";export default function Map() {  const [viewport, setViewport] = useState({  width: ""100%"",  height: ""100%"",  // The latitude and longitude of the center of London  latitude: 51.5074,  longitude: -0.1278,  zoom: 10});return &lt;ReactMapGL  mapStyle=""mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11""  mapboxApiAccessToken={process.env.MAPBOX_KEY}  {...viewport}  onViewportChange={(nextViewport) =&gt; setViewport(nextViewport)}  &gt;&lt;/ReactMapGL&gt;}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This is not going to work just yet. One of the biggest features of Next.js is the server side rendering it offers. MapBox, however, requires the global window object in order to work correctly. If you are server side rendering your app, you will need to dynamically import it into your page. This means that instead of importing it like a regular component,import Map from '../components/Map'    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We will have to import it dynamically. We will do this by using Next.js dynamic imports.In your pages/index.js file (or wherever you’re rendering your Map component) add the following code.const Map = dynamic(() =&gt; import(""../components/Map""), {  loading: () =&gt; ""Loading..."",  ssr: false});    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This means that our MapBox component will now selectively be rendered client side. Perfect!The only thing we need to do now is to add MapBox’s CSS files to our project. The easiest way to do this is to modify your existing _app.js or by adding a custom _document.js file. Then add a link to the CSS to the &lt;Head&gt; in your render function. You can get the latest version of the CSS files in their API documentation.&lt;head&gt;&lt;link href='https://api.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/v1.12.0/mapbox-gl.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;&lt;/head&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Perfect. Your Map should now be up and running! Let’s take this a step further and try rendering some clickable pins on our map.      Use MapBox’s search API to fetch a list of landmarksMapBox has a really handy geocoding API which you can be used to fetch a list of locations, with their latitudes and longitudes. We’re going to be fetching a list of Greggs (a take-away fast food and coffee shop) in London and render them as pins on our Map.First, let’s query our list by adding a simple fetch call to the Mapbox geocoding API. We want to search within the geographic bounds of London and want to cap our search at 10 results (London is huge and Londoner’s love their Gregg’s vegan sausage rolls. We don’t want to overwhelm ourselves with all the possibilities!). MapBox’s Geocoding Place Search API takes the following parameters, with some additional query strings./geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/{search_text}.json    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We will be using the limit query parameter to cap our results at 10, and the bbox parameter to specify the latitudinal and longitudinal bounds of London.With all this in mind, our search url will look something like this:https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/greggs.json?access_token=${process.env.MAPBOX_KEY}&amp;bbox=-0.227654%2C51.464102%2C0.060737%2C51.553421&amp;limit=10    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We can use this url, to make a simple fetch call in our page. Our modified page will now look something like,const Map = dynamic(() =&gt; import(""../components/Map""), {  loading: () =&gt; ""Loading..."",  ssr: false});const url = `https://api.mapbox.com/geocoding/v5/mapbox.places/greggs.json?access_token=${process.env.MAPBOX_KEY}&amp;bbox=-0.227654%2C51.464102%2C0.060737%2C51.553421&amp;limit=10`;export default function IndexPage() {  const [locations, setLocations] = useState([]);  useEffect(() =&gt; {    const fetchLocations = async () =&gt; {      await fetch(url).then((response) =&gt;        response.text()).then((res) =&gt; JSON.parse(res))      .then((json) =&gt; {        setLocations(json.features);      }).catch((err) =&gt; console.log({ err }));    };    fetchLocations();  }, []);  return (&lt;Container&gt;    &lt;Map /&gt;  &lt;/Container&gt;);}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We now have a list of 10 Greggs locations!      Using our search results to render pins on our mapNow that we have a list of places, we can render these on a Map. react-map-gl comes with a handy &lt;Marker&gt; component that makes our task pretty straight forward. First we need to pass these locations to our &lt;Map&gt; component.return (&lt;Container&gt;    &lt;Map locations={locations} /&gt;  &lt;/Container&gt;);    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now, within out Map component, we need to render a pin for each of these locations by passing their latitude and longitude to the &lt;Marker&gt; component.Our final Map component will look something like,import { useState } from ""react"";import ReactMapGL, { Marker } from ""react-map-gl"";export default function Map({ locations }) {  const [viewport, setViewport] = useState({    width: ""100%"",    height: ""100%"",    // The latitude and longitude of the center of London    latitude: 51.5074,    longitude: -0.1278,    zoom: 10  });return &lt;ReactMapGL  mapStyle=""mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11""  mapboxApiAccessToken={process.env.MAPBOX_KEY}  {...viewport}  onViewportChange={(nextViewport) =&gt; setViewport(nextViewport)}  &gt;  {locations.map((location) =&gt; (    &lt;div key={location.id}&gt;      &lt;Marker      latitude={location.center[1]}      longitude={location.center[0]}      offsetLeft={-20}      offsetTop={-10}&gt;        &lt;span role=""img"" aria-label=""push-pin""&gt;📌&lt;/span&gt;      &lt;/Marker&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;  ))}&lt;/ReactMapGL&gt;}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Making the pins clickableWe’re almost there! The last thing we want to do to make these maps fully functioning and interactive, is to add a popup with the name of the place. Again, Mapbox comes with a handy Popup component that makes this easy to do. We will simply add an onClick handler to our pins which will capture the details of the selected location, then we will pass the latitude and the longitude of the selected location to our &lt;Popup&gt; component. It’ll all be clear in a second!Within the Map component, add a useState hook to capture the selected location.export default function Map({ locations }) {  // UseState hook  const [selectedLocation, setSelectedLocation] = useState({})  const [viewport, setViewport] = useState({    width: ""100%"",    height: ""100%"",    // The latitude and longitude of the center of London    latitude: 51.5074,    longitude: -0.1278,    zoom: 10  });......    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    We will also modify the render block to add an onClick handler and the &lt;Popup&gt; component that we just mentioned.......return &lt;ReactMapGL  mapStyle=""mapbox://styles/mapbox/streets-v11""  mapboxApiAccessToken={process.env.MAPBOX_KEY}  {...viewport}  onViewportChange={(nextViewport) =&gt; setViewport(nextViewport)}  &gt;  {locations.map((location) =&gt; (    &lt;div key={location.id}&gt;      &lt;Marker      latitude={location.center[1]}      longitude={location.center[0]}      offsetLeft={-20}      offsetTop={-10}&gt;        &lt;a onClick={() =&gt; {          setSelectedLocation(location);        }}&gt;          &lt;span role=""img"" aria-label=""push-pin""&gt;📌&lt;/span&gt;        &lt;/a&gt;      &lt;/Marker&gt;      {selectLocation.id === location.id ? (      &lt;Popup      onClose={() =&gt; setSelectedLocation({})}      closeOnClick={true}      latitude={location.center[1]}      longitude={location.center[0]}&gt;        {location.place_name}      &lt;/Popup&gt;) : (false)}    &lt;/div&gt;  ))}&lt;/ReactMapGL&gt;}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The &lt;Popup&gt; component takes an onClose handler which sets the selectedLocation to {}.And that is all! We’ve managed to render a map, rendered some pins on our map and managed to make them clickable with popups! Here’s our final result:",2020-12-05T08:18:49Z,#datascience #tutorials
