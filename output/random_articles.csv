Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#283 Web scraping, the 2020 edition",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/283/web-scraping-the-2020-edition,"Web scraping is pulling the HTML of a website down and parsing useful data out of it. The use-cases for this type of functionality are endless. Have a bunch of data on governmental sites that are only listed online in HTML without a download? There's an API for that! Do you want to keep abreast of what your competitors are featuring on their site? There's an API for that. Need alerts for changes on a website, for example enrollment is now open at your college and you want to be first to get in and avoid the 8am Monday morning course slot? There's an API for that. That API is screen scraping and Attila Tóth from ScrapingHub is here to tell us all about it.Links from the showAttila Tóth on LinkedIn: linkedin.comScrapy project: scrapy.orgScrapinghub on Twitter: @scrapinghubScrapinghub: scrapinghub.comcookiecutter template for Scrapy projects: github.comSplash: headless browser designed specifically for web scraping: scrapinghub.com/splashAwesome Web Scraping list: github.comTalk Python episode 50 on web scraping: talkpython.fmHow Web Scraping is Revealing Lobbying and Corruption in Peru: blog.scrapinghub.comWeb Data Extraction Summit event: extractsummit.ioSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Streaming Data Integration Without The Code at Equalum - Episode 161,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/equalum-streaming-data-integration-episode-161/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The first stage of every good pipeline is to perform data integration. With the increasing pace of change and the need for up to date analytics the need to integrate that data in near real time is growing. With the improvements and increased variety of options for streaming data engines and improved tools for change data capture it is possible for data teams to make that goal a reality. However, despite all of the tools and managed distributions of those streaming engines it is still a challenge to build a robust and reliable pipeline for streaming data integration, especially if you need to expose those capabilities to non-engineers. In this episode Ido Friedman, CTO of Equalum, explains how they have built a no-code platform to make integration of streaming data and change data capture feeds easier to manage. He discusses the challenges that are inherent in the current state of CDC technologies, how they have architected their system to integrate well with existing data platforms, and how to build an appropriate level of abstraction for such a complex problem domain. If you are struggling with streaming data integration and change data capture then this interview is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-30T23:36:49Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#285 Dask as a Platform Service with Coiled,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/285/dask-as-a-platform-service-with-coiled,"If you're into data science, you've probably heard about Dask. It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters. While powerful, this may take some serious setup to execute in its full glory. That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson and others to launch a business to help Python loving data scientists run Dask workloads in the cloud. And they are here to tell us about they open-source foundation business.And they must be on to something, between recording and releasing this episode, they raised $5M in VC funding.Links from the showHugo on Twitter: @hugobowneMatthew on Twitter: @mrocklinCoiled: coiled.ioCoiled raised $5M in Sept: twitter.comA brief history of dask article: coiled.io/blogCoiled: Dask for Everyone, Everywhere: medium.comThe incredible growth of python: stackoverflow.blogGrowth updated (SO Trends current): insights.stackoverflow.comCoiled Youtube channel: youtube.comSnorkel package: pypi.orgSponsorsBrilliantMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-09T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,System Observability For The Cloud Native Era With Chronosphere - Episode 170,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/chronosphere-metrics-observability-episode-170/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Collecting and processing metrics for monitoring use cases is an interesting data problem. It is eminently possible to generate millions or billions of data points per second, the information needs to be propagated to a central location, processed, and analyzed in timeframes on the order of milliseconds or single-digit seconds, and the consumers of the data need to be able to query the information quickly and flexibly. As the systems that we build continue to grow in scale and complexity the need for reliable and manageable monitoring platforms increases proportionately. In this episode Rob Skillington, CTO of Chronosphere, shares his experiences building metrics systems that provide observability to companies that are operating at extreme scale. He describes how the M3DB storage engine is designed to manage the pressures of a critical system component, the inherent complexities of working with telemetry data, and the motivating factors that are contributing to the growing need for flexibility in querying the collected metrics. This is a fascinating conversation about an area of data management that is often taken for granted.",2021-02-02T02:59:59Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
