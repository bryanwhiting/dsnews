I've put together a great group to look back on 2020 - from the Python perspective. Join me along with Cecil Phillip, Ines Montani, Jay Miller, Paul Everitt, Reuven Lerner, Matt Harrison, and Brian Okken for a light-hearted and fun look back on the major Python events of 2020.Links from the showVideo version of this episode: youtube.comGuestsCecil Phillip: @cecilphillipInes Montani: @_inesmontaniJay Miller: @kjaymillerPaul Everitt: @paulweverittReuven Lerner: @reuvenmlernerMatt Harrison: @__mharrison__Brian Okken: @brianokkenSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-28T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Keeping A Bigeye On The Data Quality Market - Episode 160,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/bigeye-data-quality-market-episode-160/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"One of the oldest aphorisms about data is ""garbage in, garbage out"", which is why the current boom in data quality solutions is no surprise. With the growth in projects, platforms, and services that aim to help you establish and maintain control of the health and reliability of your data pipelines it can be overwhelming to stay up to date with how they all compare. In this episode Egor Gryaznov, CTO of Bigeye, joins the show to explore the landscape of data quality companies, the general strategies that they are using, and what problems they solve. He also shares how his own product is designed and the challenges that are involved in building a system to help data engineers manage the complexity of a data platform. If you are wondering how to get better control of your own pipelines and the traps to avoid then this episode is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-23T23:26:25Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
