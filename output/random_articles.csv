Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Data Quality Management For The Whole Team With Soda Data - Episode 178,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/soda-data-quality-management-episode-178/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Data quality is on the top of everyone's mind recently, but getting it right is as challenging as ever. One of the contributing factors is the number of people who are involved in the process and the potential impact on the business if something goes wrong. In this episode Maarten Masschelein and Tom Baeyens share the work they are doing at Soda to bring everyone on board to make your data clean and reliable. They explain how they started down the path of building a solution for managing data quality, their philosophy of how to empower data engineers with well engineered open source tools that integrate with the rest of the platform, and how to bring all of the stakeholders onto the same page to make your data great. There are many aspects of data quality management and it's always a treat to learn from people who are dedicating their time and energy to solving it for everyone.",2021-03-30T03:03:50Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Dr. Sebastian Raschka,https://sebastianraschka.com/,"Model evaluation, model selection, and algorithm selection in machine learning",https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2016/model-evaluation-selection-part1.html,"Machine learning has become a central part of our life -- as consumers, customers, and hopefully as researchers and practitioners! Whether we are applying predictive modeling techniques to our research or business problems, I believe we have one thing in common  &#58; We want to make good predictions! Fitting a model to our training data is one thing, but how do we know that it generalizes well to unseen data? How do we know that it doesn't simply memorize the data we fed it and fails to make good predictions on future samples, samples that it hasn't seen before? And how do we select a good model in the first place? Maybe a different learning algorithm could be better-suited for the problem at hand? Model evaluation is certainly not just the end point of our machine learning pipeline.Before we handle any data, we want to plan ahead and use techniques that are suited for our purposes. In this article, we will go over a selection of these techniques, and we will see how they fit into the bigger picture, a typical machine learning workflow.",2016-06-11T20:00:00Z,#tech #engineering
