But what about data engineering? Are these the same or how are they related?  Data engineering is dedicated to overcoming data-processing bottlenecks, data cleanup, data flow and data-handling problems for applications that utilize lots of data.On this episode, we welcome back Tobias Macey to give us the 30,000 ft view of the data engineering landscape in 2021.Links from the showLive Stream Recordings:YouTube: youtube.comTobias Macey: boundlessnotions.comPodcast.__init__: pythonpodcast.comData Engineering podcast: dataengineeringpodcast.comDesigning Data-Intensive Applications Book: amazon.comwally: github.comlakeFS: lakefs.ioA Beginner’s Guide to Data Engineering: medium.comApache Airflow: airflow.apache.orgDagster: dagster.ioPrefect: prefect.io#68 Crossing the streams with Podcast.__init__: talkpython.fm/68dbt: getdbt.comGreat Expectations: github.comDask: dask.orgMeltano: meltano.comLanguages trends on StackOverflow: insights.stackoverflow.comDVC: dvc.orgPandas: pandas.pydata.orgSponsorsDatadogRetoolTalk Python Training",2021-02-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#296 Python in F1 racing,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/296/python-in-f1-racing,"Quick: Name the 3 most advanced engineering organizations you can think of? Maybe an aerospace company such as SpaceX or Boeing come to mind. Maybe you thought of CERN and the LHC. But in terms of bespoke engineering capabilities, you should certainly put the F1 racing teams on your list. These organizations appear as 20-30 people on a race day shown on TV. But in fact, the number of people back at the home base doing the engineering work can be over 500 employees. Almost every tiny part you see on these cars as well as the tools to maintain them are custom-built.The engineering problems solved are immense. Would it surprise you to know that Python is playing a major role here? On this episode, you'll meet Joe Borg who help pioneer Python's adoption at several F1 teams.Links from the showJoe's website: josephb.orgJoe on Twitter: @joedborgRacing Point F1 team: racingpointf1.comScuderia Alpha Tauri F1 team: scuderiaalphatauri.comMicroK8s: microk8s.ioCharmed Kubernetes: ubuntu.com/kubernetesSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-12-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job, and hoping things work out, maybe you should start with a side-hustle.
