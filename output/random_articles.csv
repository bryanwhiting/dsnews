Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Leave Your Data Where It Is And Automate Feature Extraction With Molecula - Episode 175,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/molecula-feature-store-episode-175/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"A majority of the time spent in data engineering is copying data between systems to make the information available for different purposes. This introduces challenges such as keeping information synchronized, managing schema evolution, building transformations to match the expectations of the destination systems. H.O. Maycotte was faced with these same challenges but at a massive scale, leading him to question if there is a better way. After tasking some of his top engineers to consider the problem in a new light they created the Pilosa engine. In this episode H.O. explains how using Pilosa as the core he built the Molecula platform to eliminate the need to copy data between systems in able to make it accessible for analytical and machine learning purposes. He also discusses the challenges that he faces in helping potential users and customers understand the shift in thinking that this creates, and how the system is architected to make it possible. This is a fascinating conversation about what the future looks like when you revisit your assumptions about how systems are designed.",2021-03-09T00:32:48Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job, and hoping things work out, maybe you should start with a side-hustle. On this episode, you'll meet Keith McCormick, a data scientist who has many irons in the fire and he's here to tell us about different types of side hustles and why you may want to try or avoid one.Links from the showKeith on Twitter: @kmccormickblogKeith on LinkedIn: linkedin.comKeith's courses: linkedin.comSide Hustle Strategies for Data Science and Analytics Experts course: linkedin.com/learningTalk Python's Excel to Python course: talkpython.fm/excelSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-11-13T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters. While powerful, this may take some serious setup to execute in its full glory. That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson and others to launch a business to help Python loving data scientists run Dask workloads in the cloud. And they are here to tell us about they open-source foundation business.And they must be on to something, between recording and releasing this episode, they raised $5M in VC funding.Links from the showHugo on Twitter: @hugobowneMatthew on Twitter: @mrocklinCoiled: coiled.ioCoiled raised $5M in Sept: twitter.comA brief history of dask article: coiled.io/blogCoiled: Dask for Everyone, Everywhere: medium.comThe incredible growth of python: stackoverflow.blogGrowth updated (SO Trends current): insights.stackoverflow.comCoiled Youtube channel: youtube.comSnorkel package: pypi.orgSponsorsBrilliantMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-09T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,The power behind the Linux terminal,https://dev.to/andersonbosa/the-power-behind-the-linux-terminal-189h,"🇧🇷 Brazilian Version      Table of contentsIntroductionBasic commandsCommands that help us help each otherHave your own SnippetsPractice!      Introduction Search, differentiate, analyze, share, unzip, encrypt a file, access a cloud computer, convert a video to gif, etc. These are some of the possible things to do with the command line.The terminal is a magic wand to interact with the computer's resources. Allowing interaction practically and flexibly, which makes it a very powerful tool.Basically on all operating systems (e.g., Windows, Android, Mac and etc.), the command line is a text interface to communicate with the computer (or device).Also known as shell,console, prompt, and among other names, the terminal can be frightening and confusing at first contact. Like all new knowledge, in the beginning, there may be more difficulties. However, as we overcome these barriers, we are faced with our evolution.Knowing how to use the terminal can be essential when trying to deal with the problems that pop up daily as an IT professional. I read a post the other day when the author said something that itched me:If you are a Linux user, Terminal is probably the most powerful tool you have ever had. But the problem with Terminal is that you need to learn how to use it if you want to benefit from it. - Mauro Garcia me: YYEESSSS It scratched me to want to share a little of what I learned out there with my colleagues. And then I brought it here too. Knowing some of these things makes a difference in my day-to-day life as a software developer.I hope I can help you feel a little more comfortable the next time you need to open the terminal.      But before we start ... a tip for non-native speakers of English:Thinking in English helps to assimilate the commands!If you are like me, non-native English, I believe you will understand better what I mean.Let's understand with an example, the command pwd is for Print Working Directory. What in my language (Brazilian*) would be something like edt (Write the Working Directory).I think this example helps to make it clear that thinking about what you want to do in English helps to assimilate what is being done. Helping to internalize what you want to do. As with ls (list) or cd (change directory).      Basic commands Here are some practical commands to know. I used a command to describe them, we'll see which one is ahead.mv - move (rename) filescp - copy files and directoriesrm - remove files or directoriesls - list directory contentspwd - print name of current/working directorymkdir - make directories, create a directoryrmdir - remove empty directories, delete a directorycat - concatenate files and print on the standard outputtac - concatenate and print files in reversemore - file perusal filter for crt viewingless - opposite of morechown - change file owner and group, change ownership of a filechmod - change file mode bits, change permissions of a filechattr - change file attributes on a Linux file systemcurl - transfer a URLwget - The non-interactive network downloader.tar - an archiving utilitygzip - compress or expand files, sort of Linux 'WinRar'ping - send ICMP ECHO_REQUEST to network hostssort - sort lines of text filesfilter - cups file conversion filter interfaceuniq - report or omit repeated lineshistory - GNU History Librarytop - display Linux processesps - report a snapshot of the current processes.pkill - look up or signal processes based on name and other attributesssh - OpenSSH remote login clientgit - the stupid content trackerAll commands can be concatenated in the terminal, it is a matter of knowing how to do them. The power to concatenate commands gives us incredible power with the command line.For example, let's say we want to find which commands are in the history, but there are a lot of repetitions and irrelevant information at the moment (like the parameters) ... We could do it by unifying 4 commands in the following order: history | cut --delimiter="" "" -f 4 | sort | uniq.Or maybe you want to use an image as an icon ... You could:# 1) download the image and 2) encode it on the fly.curl https://duckduckgo.com/i/bfc48a09.jpg --output - | base64 -# is now ready to use in an HTML tag 😎      Here is precious witchcraft for the next time your virtual memory runs out:xkill - kill a client by its X resource. Basically when you proclaim this command the point of your mouse will become Alvo Dumbledore's wand. Wherever you (left) click, the thing where you clicked dies.      Commands that help us help each other whatis - display one-line manual page descriptions. It helps to identify the purpose of any command in seconds. This was the command I mentioned above.which - locate a command.whereis - locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command.man - the program manual. An interface to the system reference manuals.This is the way to anything. The relevant information about the program will be in the manual.# Try on your terminal$ whatis whatis which whereis man      Have your own Snippets A snippet is a function designed to serve a purpose. In Bash / shellscript we have the famous ""one-liners"". I recommend having them for two reasons:Fear: they obviously scare. A chain of interconnected commands to serve a purpose? I find it incredible and terrifying. ~~ Whenever I find myself running a I think that if it breaks in half it will delete my entire system 😅. ~~ With that you will be cautious with the terminal because even a hammer is bad if it is not used correctly.And news: you will be exposed to new solutions and also to new ways of using what you already know.I will leave some references on the wheel, places where we can check out these ""one-liners"". 😆      Practice! The best way to learn and assimilate is by doing. So let's put into practice what we've seen so far through some exercises. For this we will use Capture The Flag Bandit from OverTheWire.Capture The Flag is a style of competition that involves several skills to solve challenges related to infosec, to capture the flag (usually a code), and scoring. In Bandit the CTF levels take place on a remote machine, where we will connect via the terminal via ssh.Bandit will help us to put into practice and polish our skills with the Terminal. From here on, it's up to you. Good luck!#Start here!      Feedbacks 💙Was something missing, or was it wrong, or do you have any suggestions?
