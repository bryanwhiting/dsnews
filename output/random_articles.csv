What environment do you use? Was it Jupyter and now you've made the move to JupyterLab? That's a great choice. But did you know there are more environments out there to choose from and compare? Have you heard of Callisto or Iodide? How about CoCalc or PolyNote? That's just the tip of the iceberg! That's why I'm happy to have Sam Lau and Philip Guo here to share their research comparing and categorizing over 60 notebook environments.Links from the showSam on Twitter: @samlau95Philip's site: pgbovine.netThe paper: pgbovine.net/publications.htmPDF download: computational-notebooks-design-space_VLHCC-2020.pdfNBInteract: nbinteract.comNBStripout: pypi.org/project/nbstripoutAudio live coding: foxdot.orgNBDev: github.com/fastai/nbdevPyIodide episode: talkpython.fmCarnets: holzschu.github.io/Carnets_JupyterSponsorsLinodeSentry Error Monitoring, Code TALKPYTHONTalk Python Training",2020-06-13T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#283 Web scraping, the 2020 edition",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/283/web-scraping-the-2020-edition,"Web scraping is pulling the HTML of a website down and parsing useful data out of it. The use-cases for this type of functionality are endless. Have a bunch of data on governmental sites that are only listed online in HTML without a download? There's an API for that! Do you want to keep abreast of what your competitors are featuring on their site? There's an API for that. Need alerts for changes on a website, for example enrollment is now open at your college and you want to be first to get in and avoid the 8am Monday morning course slot? There's an API for that. That API is screen scraping and Attila Tóth from ScrapingHub is here to tell us all about it.Links from the showAttila Tóth on LinkedIn: linkedin.comScrapy project: scrapy.orgScrapinghub on Twitter: @scrapinghubScrapinghub: scrapinghub.comcookiecutter template for Scrapy projects: github.comSplash: headless browser designed specifically for web scraping: scrapinghub.com/splashAwesome Web Scraping list: github.comTalk Python episode 50 on web scraping: talkpython.fmHow Web Scraping is Revealing Lobbying and Corruption in Peru: blog.scrapinghub.comWeb Data Extraction Summit event: extractsummit.ioSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
