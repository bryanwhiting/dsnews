If you are putting your workflows into production, then you need to consider how you are going to implement data security, including access controls and auditing. Different databases and storage systems all have their own method of restricting access, and they are not all compatible with each other. In order to simplify the process of securing your data in the Cloud Manav Mital created Cyral to provide a way of enforcing security as code. In this episode he explains how the system is architected, how it can help you enforce compliance, and what is involved in getting it integrated with your existing systems. This was a good conversation about an aspect of data management that is too often left as an afterthought.",2020-10-26T22:45:48Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Database Design and the GDPR,https://dev.to/cerchie/database-design-and-the-gdpr-463p,"*knowledge dependencies for understanding this article include beginner's SQL(including ON_DELETE CASCADE) and beginner's database designThe first thing I want to do is acknowledge that the inspiration and one of the resources for this article was a conversation I had with Don Omondi. He's a wonderful teacher.Ok, so what is the GDPR? It's a privacy and security law written by the EU, which affects any company that targets or collects data related to people in the EU. The effect it had (and still has as cookies evolve) on cookies is extensive. It also affected database design. One of the rights of EU citizens according the GDPR is the right to erasure. This means that, under a certain set of circumstances, EU citizens have the right to have their personal data erased. It's also known as the 'right to be forgotten.' What impact does this have on database design? Say you're running a site where users can repost other user's posts. User Sally has written a post that user Jenna has reposted.Now, Sally wants to delete her account on your site. If you've set up your tables such that ON_DELETE CASCADE deletes Sally's data and all the associated data, you've also deleted the content of Jenna's repost. What are you going to do?Enter the soft delete. Soft deletes have a lot of advantages, and many websites use them for many reasons. Soft deletes allow you to un-delete easily: ""Without the soft delete in place, a delete() call on an object will delete the record from the table using a DELETE statement. With the soft delete in place, an UPDATE statement is sent instead (that sets the deletedAt field to the current time)."" sourceSo now, you have to decide what deleting Sally's account means now that you're using a soft delete. If you've implemented a soft delete to prevent things like Jenna's content on her repost disappearing, you might call it a 'deactivation' instead. Sally can come back and retrieve all her data at any time by reactivating her account, and Jenna's repost content can stick around. Then the GDPR comes out.If your database is set up like this, you can't easily comply with the right to be forgotten. How are you going to solve this problem?You might license the content that users write under the Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike license.  That way you can save content, but the user can effectively delete their personal info. You remove their info from your database and anonymize their content. Stack Overflow has taken this route. For example of what this looks like, take this user on Stack Overflow: The GDPR is awesome for a lot of reasons-- it's introduced protection for the data of EU citizens, and along with this protection has come exciting new problems to solve. I'm sure there are myriad ways to protect the rights of users under the GDPR. I'd love to hear other solutions in the comments. ü§î",2020-12-12T15:35:35Z,#datascience #tutorials

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Today I made my first pull request on GitHub! Here's how you can do the same!,https://dev.to/codewithfahad/today-i-made-my-first-pull-request-on-github-here-s-how-you-can-do-the-same-3bje,"Many developers like myself, use GitHub for sharing their code with others. GitHub is a fantastic platform for collaboration on open-source as well as personal projects. üöÄAn important part of code collaboration on GitHub is opening a pull request.      ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What's a pull request?Put it simply, a pull request is a way to merge your changes into the original code. Let's say you want to contribute to an open-source project or work on a personal project. You made changes to the code and now want to merge it with the main branch. That's when you need a pull request. If you want to work on an open-source project, learning to make a pull request is an important thing to know.      ‚ö° Steps to make a pull request on GitHubHere are the steps to follow for making your first ever pull request on GitHub!      üç¥ Step 1: Fork the repositorySo, you've chosen a repository to contribute to. Maybe it's a popular open-source project or some project you are working on with your team or friends.The first thing to do is to head on over to the repository and fork it. Forking it will make a copy of the repository and it will show in your repository list.To fork a repo, simply click on the fork button on GitHub.The repository will be forked and will now show in your own repository list. Underneath it will also show from which account the repository was forked.      üîÆ Step 2: Clone the repositoryThe second step is to clone the repository. Then you can start making changes to it. Head on over to your GitHub repositories and open the newly forked repository. Then you can use the repo's URL to clone it. Simply click on the green code button on the top right and copy the repo's HTTPS URL.The open git bash on your machine and use the following command to clone the repo:git clone &lt;your_repo_url&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    The repository is cloned on your machine. Now you can make changes to it!      üß± Step 3: Make a new branchBefore making changes, it is a good practice to make a new branch commonly called the feature branch. You can make your changes in this branch before opening a pull request. It is strongly discouraged to make changes directly on the master or main branch of the repository.In order to make a new branch and switch to it use the following command:git checkout -b &lt;your_branch_name&gt;    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    -b flag will allow you to switch to the newly created branch immediately.This will create a new branch of the specified name and will switch to it also. In order to confirm which branch you're on, use this command:git branch    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Finally, you can start coding now!      üèÜ Step 4: Make changes and commitNow make whatever changes you want to make to the code. Maybe it's a bug fix or you're trying to add a new feature. Do what you gotta do! üòÖ As you make changes, make small commits with clear commit messages. These commits are made to the feature branch and will be reflected in the main branch once you're code gets merged.Once you're happy with the changes and have committed them, it's now time to open a pull request on GitHub!      üì¢ Step 5: Make a pull requestNow head on over to the forked repo on GitHub. A message will automatically be displayed showing that your new branch is ahead of the main branch. And it will prompt you to open a new pull request. If this does not show up you can always use the pull request tab to create a new pull request. Then click on create a new pull request and select your new branch as the compare branch and. It will compare this branch with the main or master branch which is the base branch.Then you have to enter a title for the pull request and a description. It is advised to write a clear description of the changes made and /or bugs that this pull request fixes. keep your tone nice and respectful! Then once you're done with the message click on the create pull request button to make a new pull request.That's it! You've successfully made your first pull request on GitHub. It will show up in the pull request tab of the original repo. Once the repo's owner reviews it they can then merge your pull request and your code will be merged with the main branch.In order to learn more about creating branches, making commits, opening pull requests, etc. check out this amazing guide by GitHub: Understanding the GitHub flow.      üôè That's all folks!That's pretty much it. A super-quick guide on making a pull request on GitHub. Today, I made my first pull request on GitHub and the code was merged as well. It was not only a great learning experience but also felt good to contribute to a project! üòÖNow that you know how to do it, feel free to try it out yourself. Thanks for reading and happy coding! üòÄ      üåç Follow me around the web!TwitterBlogGitHub",2020-12-12T07:06:22Z,#datascience #tutorials
