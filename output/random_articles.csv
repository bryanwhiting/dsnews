Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Streaming Data Integration Without The Code at Equalum - Episode 161,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/equalum-streaming-data-integration-episode-161/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The first stage of every good pipeline is to perform data integration. With the increasing pace of change and the need for up to date analytics the need to integrate that data in near real time is growing. With the improvements and increased variety of options for streaming data engines and improved tools for change data capture it is possible for data teams to make that goal a reality. However, despite all of the tools and managed distributions of those streaming engines it is still a challenge to build a robust and reliable pipeline for streaming data integration, especially if you need to expose those capabilities to non-engineers. In this episode Ido Friedman, CTO of Equalum, explains how they have built a no-code platform to make integration of streaming data and change data capture feeds easier to manage. He discusses the challenges that are inherent in the current state of CDC technologies, how they have architected their system to integrate well with existing data platforms, and how to build an appropriate level of abstraction for such a complex problem domain. If you are struggling with streaming data integration and change data capture then this interview is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-30T23:36:49Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Building on this pattern, the team at Hightouch have created a platform that synchronizes information about your customers out to third party systems for use by marketing and sales teams. In this episode Tejas Manohar explains the benefits of sourcing customer data from one location for all of your organization to use, the technical challenges of synchronizing the data to external systems with varying APIs, and the workflow for enabling self-service access to your customer data by your marketing teams. This is an interesting conversation about the importance of the data warehouse and how it can be used beyond just internal analytics.",2021-01-19T02:16:10Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job, and hoping things work out, maybe you should start with a side-hustle.

DEV Community,https://dev.to,7 easy ways to become a better developer,https://dev.to/pascavld/7-easy-ways-to-become-a-better-developer-36l6,"IntroductionI've read dozen of articles on how to become a better developer in the past yearHere are 7 ways to do so      1. Code every day for as much as you can.This is important especially when you're first starting.You can code for as little as 15 minutes.It's a lot better to learn for one hour every day than for 7 hours in one day once a week.      2. Practice makes perfect.The only difference between you and the developers that are better than you is that they practiced more.But it's also very important how you practice which leads us to the point 3...      3. Active learning &gt;&gt; passive learning.What this means? It's a lot better to learn by building projects and playing around with the concepts you learned than just watching the tutorial.So start building something as fast as you can.      4. Google.Use Google as much as you can. Every time you don't remember something or can't solve a problem use Google.Googling is one of the most important skills of a developer. Use it as a tool to get your job done faster.      5. Find what resources work the best for you.Some people learn the best from video courses. Others from books. And others just from building something.Make sure you take some time to find which one works the best for you.      6. Avoid Tutorial HellWhat does Tutorial Hell mean? It's that thing when you go from one tutorial to another without building something.This is the worst thing you can do to yourself because you feel that you're learning something but in reality, you are not.      7. Avoid distractions when learning how to codeIf you want to learn something new you need to be 100% focused on that. If you check your phone every 5 minutes you'll get nowhere.Remember that 1 hour of focused work is a lot better than 3 hours of distracted work.
