Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Bringing Feature Stores and MLOps to the Enterprise At Tecton - Episode 166,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/tecton-mlops-feature-store-episode-166/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"As more organizations are gaining experience with data management and incorporating analytics into their decision making, their next move is to adopt machine learning. In order to make those efforts sustainable, the core capability they need is for data scientists and analysts to be able to build and deploy features in a self service manner. As a result the feature store is becoming a required piece of the data platform. To fill that need Kevin Stumpf and the team at Tecton are building an enterprise feature store as a service. In this episode he explains how his experience building the Michelanagelo platform at Uber has informed the design and architecture of Tecton, how it integrates with your existing data systems, and the elements that are required for well engineered feature store.",2021-01-05T00:44:57Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#281 Python in Car Racing,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/281/python-in-car-racing,"I love to bring you stories of Python being used in amazing places outside the traditional tech silos of pure web development and data science. On this episode, you'll meet Robert ""Kane"" Replogle, who works on the simulation and test software at Richard Childress Racing. The NASCAR team that just finished #1 and 2 in at the Texas Motor Speedway. You'll hear how Python is allowing them to model car behavior, air flow, and more much faster than others using outdated tools.

Our guest, on this episode, Clark Petri is here to tell us all about pyomo. This is a library that can solve all sorts of cool problems, linear programming, nonlinear equations, and many other things you can throw at it.  We're gonna solve a really fun diet problem: What is the most nutritious meal that you can eat for the least amount of money? The answer might surprise you a little bit! It's going to be a lot of fun. So listen in to hear about how Clark has used pyomo to do his work and how you might use it in yours.Links from the showPyomo: pyomo.orgClark on Twitter: @clarkpetriCenter for Infrastructure Defense: nps.eduThesis: apps.dtic.milI’m not alone in my work post: morenuance.comhandcalcs package: github.comDiet optimization problem: nbviewer.jupyter.orgTalk Python [Pro Edition]: talkpython.fm/proBlack Friday at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/blackfridaySponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-22T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
