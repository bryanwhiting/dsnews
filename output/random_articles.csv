Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebastián Ramírez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
