Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Keeping A Bigeye On The Data Quality Market - Episode 160,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/bigeye-data-quality-market-episode-160/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"One of the oldest aphorisms about data is ""garbage in, garbage out"", which is why the current boom in data quality solutions is no surprise. With the growth in projects, platforms, and services that aim to help you establish and maintain control of the health and reliability of your data pipelines it can be overwhelming to stay up to date with how they all compare. In this episode Egor Gryaznov, CTO of Bigeye, joins the show to explore the landscape of data quality companies, the general strategies that they are using, and what problems they solve. He also shares how his own product is designed and the challenges that are involved in building a system to help data engineers manage the complexity of a data platform. If you are wondering how to get better control of your own pipelines and the traps to avoid then this episode is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-23T23:26:25Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#272 No IoT things in hand? Simulate them with Device Simulator Express,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/272/no-iot-things-in-hand-simulate-them-with-device-simulator-express,"Python is one of the primary languages for IoT devices. With runtimes such as CircuitPython and MicroPython, they are ideal for the really small IoT chips. Maybe you've heard of the Circuit Playground Express, BBC micro:bit, or the fancy Adafruit CLUE.  They aren't too expensive (ranging from $25 to $50 each). But for large groups such as classrooms, this can be a lot of money. Moreover, getting your hands on these devices can sometimes be tricky as well. With an extension for VS Code called Device simulator express, you can have instant access to all three (virtually of course). This cool extension adds a visual emulator as well as the native interactions such as buttons and temperature sensors.Get your IoT on without a real device using VS code today. Let's meet the most recent team behind this project:Guests* Andrea Mah* Sayyeda Mussa* Vandy Liu* Xuan-Nam Kevin NguyenLinks from the showDevice simulator express: microsoft.comSource code: github.comMakecode: microsoft.comMeet the team (short video intro): youtu.beOverview video: youtu.beDevicesCircuit Playground Express: adafruit.comCLUE: adafruit.comBBC micro:bit: microbit.orgSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-12T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#276 Geekout: Life in the solar system and beyond,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/276/geekout-life-in-the-solar-system-and-beyond,"We're back with another GeekOut episode. Richard Campbell, a developer and podcaster who also dives deep into science and tech topics, is back for our second GeekOut episode. Last time we geeked out about the real science and progress around a moon base. This time it's why is there life on Earth, where could it be or have been in the solar system, and beyond. In case you didn't catch the first GeekOut, episode 253, this one is more of a general science and tech episode. I love digging into the deep internals of all the tools of the Python space, but given all that is going on in the world, I thought it'd be fun to take a step back and just enjoy some fun geekery and give you all something to just sit back and let your mind dream.Links from the showRichard on Twitter: @richcampbellAll Richard's GeekOut Episodes: geekout.showMoonbase Geekout Episode: talkpython.fm/253High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC): sacd.larc.nasa.govNew Horizons: solarsystem.nasa.govThe Planets: Saturn - NOVA documentary (Cassini): pbs.orgMission to Jupiter - Galileo: jpl.nasa.govSponsorsBrilliantTalk Python Training",2020-08-06T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#282 pre-commit framework,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/282/pre-commit-framework,"Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before committing your code. Hooks run on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as trailing whitespace and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks. As we created more libraries and projects we recognized that sharing our pre-commit hooks across projects is painful. That's why I'm happy to welcome Anthony Sottile to the show to discuss  pre-commit, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.Links from the showAnthony at Twitter: @codewithanthonypre-commit: pre-commit.compre-commit continuous integration: pre-commit.cipre-commit hooks: pre-commit.com/hooks.htmlpre-commit on GitHub: github.comshhgit secret discovery project: github.combabi editor: github.comTwitch stream: twitch.tvAnthony on GitHub: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-17T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,My VS Code Setup,https://dev.to/anshdhinhgra47/my-vs-code-setup-4997,"VS Code is one of the best editors out there in the market. And not just for the sake that is launched by Microsoft, it has some really amazing features, the primary one being, allowing developers to install extensions and use as per their requirement.      Why do we need extensions ?As a developer, you tend to achieve your goals in the minimum time possible. Coding the same 5 lines can be really tiring. That is where extension come in handy. Just 4 words and voilà! the entire syntax is laid out. While some of them autofill the syntax, there are some that provide a variety of themes. As a dark theme lover, I have plenty of them installed in my editor and I shall be sharing them with you!!      Extension I useJust like you, I have scrolled through various articles and Instagram posts, talking about the top 20 VS Code extensions that every developer must have. Every developer ranks these extensions in the way they like. I did use them and some of them didn't suit me. And that's perfectly alright! Extensions are only a helping hand in making your lives easier. Coding the application and deploying it, is something that only a developer can do and not any extension.Here are the extensions that you'll find in my VS Code:      Themes and Appearance:Atom One Dark Theme - Mahmoud AliAyu - teabyiiCommunity Material Theme - Mattia AstorinoDracula Official - Dracula ThemeHelium Icon Theme - Helgard Richard FerreiraMaterial Icon Theme - Philipp KiefMaterial Theme Icons - Mattia AstorinoOne Dark Pro - binaryifyOne Monokai Theme - Joshua AzemohPalenight Theme - Olaolu OlawuyiPanda Theme - Panda Theme (one of my favourites!)A sneek peek in one of my projects with Panda ThemeSynthwave'84 - Robb Owenvscode-icons - VSCode Icons Team      Tools and Productivity:      Auto Close Tag - Jun HanThis extension automatically adds the closing tag while writing HTML or XML syntax      Auto Import - steoatesProbably the most helpful one, this extension automatically generates the import statement, in case you forget to import a snippet and have called it in your codeComes in handy while making TypeScript or React Applications      Auto Rename Tag - Jun HanThis extension automatically renames the closing tag when you rename the opening tag.      Auto Open Markdown Preview - hnwWhile editing README files in your editor, this extension allows you to look at your changes directly in your editor. You can also open the preview in another pane and the changes you make are automatically reflected.      Better Align - wwmThis extension allows you to perfectly indent your code without any hassle      Better Comments - Aaron BondThis extension allows you to have beautiful comments in your code. It allows you to add highlights, notes, alerts and much more      Bracket Pair Colorizer - CoenraadSOne of the best in the market, this extension highlights matching brackets so that as a developer, you are not confused while closing the wrong type of bracket      Code Time - SoftwareI tend to keep a record of the time I have coded on a particular day and this extension helps me with it. Not only that, but it also provides a detailed analytics of the time spent on a particular file, the total no. of lines coded etc.      ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets - dsznajderBeing a React developer, this extension helps me whenever I need to write a React Syntax in a file. It automatically generates the function and the import statements, and does much more than that.      Live Server - Ritwick DeyProbably the most talked about, this is a must-have extension since it automatically creates a server for you to view your files. Any changes in your files are automatically reflected in the server.       Path Intellisense - Christian KohlerThis extension automatically completes the filenames as you import/export a file.      Prettier - Code Formatter  -  PrettierNeatly formats your code. It includes support for JavaScript, JSX, Vue, Angular, etc.      React PropTypes Intellisense - Of Human BondageFinds the type of props in React and automatically generates a snippet to be added in the React ComponentThose are all the VS Code extensions that I use.
