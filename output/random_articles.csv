Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#293 Learning how to learn as a developer,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/293/learning-how-to-learn-as-a-developer,"As software developers, we live in a world of uncertainty and flux. Do you need to build a new web app? Well maybe using Django makes the most sense if you've been doing it for a long time. There is Flask, but it's more mix and match being a microframework. But you've also heard that async and await are game changers and FastAPI might be the right choice. Whatever it is you're building, there is constant pressure to stay on top of a moving target. Learning is not something you do in school then get a job as a developer. No, it a constant and critical part of your career. That's why we all need to be good, very good, at it.Matt Harrison is back on Talk Python to talk to us about some tips, tricks, and even science about learning as software developers.Links from the showMatt on Twitter: @__mharrison__Matt's Learning Course (use code TALKPYTHON20 for 20% off): mattharrison.podia.comFriends of the show: talkpython.fm/friends-of-the-showStreamlit: streamlit.ioJupyter LSP: github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lspSponsorsBrilliantLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebastián Ramírez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#287 Testing without dependencies, mocking in Python",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/287/testing-without-dependencies-mocking-in-python,"We know our unit tests should be relatively independent from other parts of the system. For example, running a test shouldn't generally call a credit card possessing API and talk to a database when your goal is just to test the argument validation. And yet, your method does all three of those and more. What do you do? Some languages use elaborate dependency passing frameworks that go under the banner of inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injections (DI). In Python, the most common fix is to temporarily redefine what those two functions do using patching and mocking.On this episode, we welcome back Anna-Lena Pokes to talk us through the whole spectrum of test doubles, dummies, mocks, and more.Links from the showAnna-Lena's personal site: alpopkes.com100 Days of Code episode: talkpython.fm/186Anna-Lena on Github: github.comPyCon talk from Lisa Road (2018) - “Demystifying the patch function”: youtube.comPyCon talk from Edwin Jung (2019) - Mocking and Patching Pitfalls: youtube.comKeynote talk “Finding Magic in Python” (about magical universeproject): youtube.comBlog post about mocking in Python: alpopkes.comStackoverflow post on difference between stubs and mocks: stackoverflow.comFreezegun project: github.comKI Macht Schule (AI goes to school): ki-macht-schule.deCode Combat: codecombat.comPDB++: github.comSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
