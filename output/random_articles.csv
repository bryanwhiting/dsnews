DEV Community,https://dev.to,My journey into software engineering role at Microsoft,https://dev.to/elamoscicka/my-journey-into-software-engineering-role-at-microsoft-35o3,"I was thinking about writing this kind of a summary of my journey for quite some time. And even though it is still ongoing, I decided to share it as I truly believe that ‚Äúsharing is caring‚Äù: maybe it will inspire someone else to follow their dreams, maybe someone is also learning how to code and is having one of the ‚ÄúOmg, I don‚Äôt know anything and can‚Äôt code‚Äù moments. Whatever the reason is, I hope you‚Äôll enjoy reading it üòâ      How it all started‚Ä¶I think first time when I was super happy about being able to build something on my own was high school. During one of Informatics classes teacher introduced QBasic to us. We were practicing it and I decided to solve one of his tasks he prepared for us. It took me quite some time (and a lot of lines of code) but in the end it worked! I showed it to him, and he quickly made changes: my code was rewritten to just few lines. I cannot remember why I didn‚Äôt continue back then. What I remember though is the fact that I was considering choosing mathematics as one of the exams for my secondary school certificate, but in the end, I picked geography. Why? I discussed my plans with one of my teachers and I heard from her: ‚Äúyou better go with geography; it will be easier‚Äù.Second time was during ‚ÄúRails Girls Warsaw‚Äù Ruby on Rails workshops (if you never heard of them go and check what they‚Äôre doing). It was the time when I was already working in recruitment industry. I was super curious to learn more about that community and ROR but wasn‚Äôt seriously thinking about changing my career. Here I‚Äôd like to pause for a moment and say huge ‚ÄúTHANK YOU‚Äù to our Mentor: Olga Grabek! üôÇEverything changed when I joined Microsoft in August 2014. Working with passionate people, on the projects using latest technologies made me feel that it would be good to get better understanding of how particular languages and programs works ‚Äì not only know theory. And as I am primarily hiring Software Engineers and working closely with Managers who are building/growing their teams, I decided to take next step.      Learning through online coursesCodecademy:I was already actively using Twitter at the time I decided ‚ÄúI want to learn how to code!‚Äú and I think thanks to it I found out about Codecademy.Based on my experience I can highly recommend it and together with freeCodeCamp they‚Äôre just perfect (in my opinion üòâ) for all beginners. They are free and user friendly: you do not have to install anything; you just log in into your account and write code directly there!Udacity:At some point I felt that it would be good to try something else. Thanks to social media (again:) I learnt about Udacity. I decided to give it a try and it was very good decision: while Codecademy was mostly about reading text and doing tasks, here you have videos with topics being explained by industry experts. Depending on language you want to learn or ‚Äúpath‚Äù you want complete you might be doing some coding on their website or using your IDE. There is a lot of free content available, but they also have some paid Nanodegree programs.Udemy:They offer a lot of courses ‚Äì the trick is everyone can create content and become ‚Äúan expert‚Äù. I would recommend you do some search online before investing money (even if it is only 10 euro) into something that might be not worth it.Thanks to being part of #100DaysOfCode, #301DaysOfCode, #WomenInTech community on Twitter I was able to select great courses. When I started feeling more comfortable with coding and wanted to finally understand Algorithms and Data Structures, I bought ‚ÄúJavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Masterclass‚Äù course by Colt Steele. I finished it long time ago, but as I want to refresh my knowledge will be going through it again soon.      Videos on YoutubeThere is some interesting content out there! As I‚Äôm using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React I often check what new videos have Brad from Traversy Media and The Net Ninja uploaded. Thanks to Brad I discovered Materialize and built my personal website based on it! üôÇ      Meetups and Tech eventsIt can be fun to attend them! Not only you have a chance to learn more about various topics, but you also have an opportunity to network (NEVER miss networking -&gt; that is often the best part of every meetup or tech event!).Don‚Äôt be afraid if you don‚Äôt know anyone: I recently met girl who came to the meetup because she had free time during the evening. Her background was not tech and she told me she doesn‚Äôt understand what speakers are telling about, but she likes the atmosphere and people.And never think ‚Äúyou‚Äôre not smart enough‚Äù to attend them. When in summer 2018 I noticed on Twitter that WarsawJS is organizing regularly meetups (every month, if you‚Äôre in Warsaw join us!) I just thought ‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm going‚Äù. I knew that few people I am following on social media will be there, so it was a little bit easier for me but believe me: I had NO IDEA what they are talking about.There are still cases when I feel like this, but the more I am into coding and going to meetups/tech event, the easier it is for me to understand them.      Programming WorkshopsWarsawJS community is HUGE. And organizers (shout out to: Kasia Grabowska, Piotr Kowalski and Piotr Zientara) are not limiting themselves to meetup only: they‚Äôve also programming workshops.I was super excited to go on my very first workshop (it was about ‚Äúunit testing‚Äù)! If you want to know how I felt sitting there among all other people who were already working as Developers and knew what do to have a look at this pic below (I just love it &lt;3)Did I know what to do? NO. Was I lost? Yes. But as group was really supportive (as well as our Trainer Rafa≈Ç Pocztarski) and I‚Äôm the type of person that whenever I don‚Äôt know something I ask until I get the answer, I was able to understand a lot in the end:) I even made pull request to GitHub repository that improved frontend part of the application we have been working on!Outcome: I liked that workshop that much that I decided to go on another one..and another‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶ In total I took part in 7! And I was even able to help others when they were stuck or lost during coding.Here‚Äôs full list if you are interested what I was learning about.      Working on my own projects (social media, mentoring, GitHub)That was probably the most difficult part. Online courses, YouTube videos, workshops are great because you are following someone else. They tell you what to do and how to build app. But when you are about to start building something on your own, that is when ‚Äúso how do I write that code‚Äù thoughts are coming.I consider myself super lucky because thanks to my activity on social media (one more time let‚Äôs mention Twitter here;) I ‚Äúmet‚Äù many great people who were helping me overcome many challenges (Wassim Chegham ‚Äì thank you for your patience, you saved me many times!).Another benefit of being active online is community. If you‚Äôre using Twitter I‚Äôd advise you to follow i.e.: #100DaysOfCode, #301DaysOfCode, #CodeNewbie. You‚Äôll see what they‚Äôre working on, you‚Äôll understand that you‚Äôre not alone and you‚Äôre not the only one struggling with writing code.2 years ago, I decided that ‚ÄúI want to become a Software Engineer and I need a mentor!‚Äù. I discussed that idea with my colleague from Engineering Recruitment team, Milena Iwa≈Ñska and she asked me ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you find a mentor at Microsoft?‚Äù. If you think I was 100% supportive of this at that time, you are wrong. I was full of doubts and wasn‚Äôt sure someone will be willing to mentor me (2 years ago I was just starting seriously learning coding, so let‚Äôs say I knew ‚Äúzero‚Äù).Long story short: in the end I found 2 mentors at Microsoft (one of them was my former candidate and we‚Äôre still continuing mentoring sessions ‚Äì thank you Martin Petrla, I wouldn‚Äôt made it that far without you!). I also learned what mentoring means to me and that I cannot imagine having sessions with someone who does not believe in me.The more time I spent working on my projects, the more I believe in myself. I keep track of all my coding/learning activity on my GitHub. The project I‚Äôm most proud of: I was able to built from scratch my very first Chrome extension with Martin‚Äôs help (you can find it here: ).      ChallengesThose are the most important challenges I had (or still have) to overcome while I‚Äôm following my dream to become a Software Engineer:Changing career path &amp; switching to another role is not easy and does not happen overnight. You need to put a lot of energy, time and passion into it, otherwise you will not succeed.Combing full-time role &amp; learning how to code ‚Äì I wish I would have more time to code and that way make faster progress, but I‚Äôve ‚Äú9-5 job‚Äù and family. I also need to find time to relax and take care of myself. And sometimes I am just too tired to code and not opening my laptop for a week (the longest break I had was around 2 months).Believing in myself ‚Äì we all have ups and downs. I had few moments when I wanted to quit, because I did not know how to write to code or I considered myself ‚Äútoo stupid to learn coding‚Äù. Being part of #100DaysOfCode, #301DaysOfCode, #CodeNewbie communities is great, but you can sometimes feel like you are doing less (or less cool things) than others. In my case I was also comparing myself to people already working at Microsoft as Software Engineers and believe me, I felt frustrated many time (luckily that was mostly in the beginning and I am not doing it now).Resources ‚Äì there are many resources available and that is great. At the same time, it can be hard to pick the right one.Trying to learn everything ‚Äì I always like to get deeper understanding of how particular things works, how they are connected, but at some point, I just had to focus on one area and stop jumping between topics.Haters ‚Äì they are present and no matter how hard you are trying, there always will be people trying to put you down. Below are just a couple of thigs I have been hearing from completely anonymous people as well as from people who know me:‚ÄúFrontend is not serious programming‚Äù‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just nice face looking for attention‚Äù‚ÄúHahaha, good luck‚Äù      LearningsBelow are some learning I want to share with you:Be open about learning new thingsela ‚Äì as I had moments when I doubted my skills, it took me some time to start being open about my plans and career aspiration. Since I became more confident I started sharing my coding journey on LinkedIn, Twitter and also on Instagram. I believe it might be helpful for other people following their dreams üòâTrack your coding progress ‚Äì this is what I decided to do. GitHub is perfect place for that. Also, you never know who might find your repositories useful!Attend meetups/tech events and programming workshop, be active on social media ‚Äì all those things will help you on your journey!Don‚Äôt compare yourself to others ‚Äì what you see is just a part of ‚Äútheir journey‚Äù. You don‚Äôt know how they life looks like or how much time they have to learn. Find your own pace.Taking a break is important ‚Äì don‚Äôt put a pressure on yourself that you have to code every day. If you feel that you need a break just do it. Otherwise you might soon find yourself frustrated.Never give up ‚Äì progress is progress no matter how small. Some people will change role in few months, others will spend a year or more to achieve their goal.This was my very personal story about becoming a Software Engineer, I hope it will have a ‚Äúhappy ending‚Äù üôÇ Maybe you are also considering career change? Or you‚Äôre currently learning programming?

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Binary Search Algorithm Explained,https://dev.to/techlearners/binary-search-algorithm-explained-2nn5,"In the world of computer science, Binary Search Algorithm is the ground of the ‚Äú Divide &amp; Conquer‚Äù algorithmic paradigm. This algorithm is the easiest illustration of how ‚ÄúDivide and Conquer‚Äù works. Using this algorithm searching can be done in O(log(n)) time where linear search takes O(n) time in the worst case. It saves time and makes the number of comparisons to perform fewer.Let us consider a scenario. Suppose, you have a book of 1000 pages and we need to go to page number 580 and check whether the page exists or not. By using the linear search algorithm, you can start looking for the desired page from the beginning or the end. In both ways, you have to search over a large number of pages to find page number 580 as we are checking every page on our way. But, can we do it better? Can we find our desired page by making fewer comparisons? The answer is: Yes, we can do it in a faster way. We can do the improvement in less time by using the ‚ÄúBinary Search Algorithm‚Äù. First, we need to keep in mind that this algorithm can be correctly applied if the data is sorted. In the case of page numbers of a book, the data is sorted. Here, we have page numbers from 1 to 1000 in a sorted manner. We need to find page number 580. Let‚Äôs divide our searching area into two halves. Get the midpoint of range 1 to 1000 like this, mid-index = (ending index+starting index-1)/2. So, it goes like this,(1000 / 2) = 500. Compare 500 (mid-index) with 580 (searching index). 580 is larger than 500 so it cannot be present in the range (1- 500). So, let‚Äôs exclude it from our searching area. Now, we have (501‚Äì1000) numbered pages for searching. Repeat the previous process and get the midpoint of the range (501 -1000). It will be 750. Compare 580 again with 750. And fix the new searching area as (501 -750) and exclude the range in which the number cannot be present. Keep repeating the process until you find the exact number or reach a situation when there are no numbers left to search. In this process, you can find the desired number in log(n) time and you need to perform a very fewer number of comparisons than linear search as after every comparison we are making our searching area small by excluding areas in which searching is unnecessary. So, the method is very simple when you have a sorted data set and need to find something in the data set rather than keep checking every element in the data set one by one, keep dividing the data set into two halves and compare the value with mid-value.This algorithm is frequently used in small to big tasks in computer science. Some other important algorithms like Merge Sort also use the concept of divide and conquer. If you understand this algorithm well, you will get the basic idea of the ‚ÄúDivide &amp; Conquer‚Äù paradigm which is surely going to help you in learning more complex algorithms in the future. The most important thing to remember is, whenever you are going to apply the binary search algorithm the data must be placed in a sorted manner otherwise you cannot apply binary search. If you are going to start competitive programming must know the binary search algorithm as you will find problems that needed to be solved by directly using the binary search algorithm or using the concept of the binary search algorithm.‚≠ê I have attached here my code implementation of the binary search algorithm in Python &amp; C++ programming language ‚≠ê‚ú¥Ô∏è Code Implementation in Pythondef main():    given_array = [1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 11]    find = 8  # Number to search.    number_found = False  # Determines if the number is found or not.    start_index = 0    end_index = len(given_array) - 1    while end_index &gt; start_index:        mid_index = (end_index + start_index - 1) // 2        if given_array[mid_index] == find:            number_found = True            break        elif given_array[mid_index] &gt; find:            end_index = mid_index - 1        else:            start_index = mid_index + 1    if number_found:        print(""The Desired Element Is Present!"")    else:        print(""The Desired Element Is Not Present"")if __name__ == ""__main__"":    main()    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    ‚ú¥Ô∏è Code Implementation in C++#include&lt;iostream&gt;#include&lt;stdio.h&gt;using namespace std;int main(){    int arr[5]= {1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12}; // given array.    int y = 9; // Element to search is stored in variable y.    int l = 0;  // l = Lower Index    int h = n; // h = Higher Index    int m; // m = Middle Index    // Start of the loop to perform ""Binary Search Algorithm"".    while(l &lt;= h) // The loop will run until there is one element left in array.    {        m = (l + h)/2; // Find the mid to divide the array into two almost equal parts.        if(y == arr[m]) // If the element is in the mid, we found it!        {            break;  // Break the loop.        }        if(y &lt; arr[m]) // If search element is lesser than element at the mid, cut the higher part of the array.        {            h = m - 1;        }        else          // Else cut the lower part of the array.        {            l = m + 1;        }    }    if(l &gt; h)    {        printf( ""%d not found\n"", y);    }    else    {        printf( ""%d found!"", y);    }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          ConclusionSo far, I‚Äôve tried to show everything steps by step, and below, the discussion section is open for your opinion to share and of course the questions if any.
