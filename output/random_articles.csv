Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#287 Testing without dependencies, mocking in Python",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/287/testing-without-dependencies-mocking-in-python,"We know our unit tests should be relatively independent from other parts of the system. For example, running a test shouldn't generally call a credit card possessing API and talk to a database when your goal is just to test the argument validation. And yet, your method does all three of those and more. What do you do? Some languages use elaborate dependency passing frameworks that go under the banner of inversion of control (IoC) and dependency injections (DI). In Python, the most common fix is to temporarily redefine what those two functions do using patching and mocking.On this episode, we welcome back Anna-Lena Pokes to talk us through the whole spectrum of test doubles, dummies, mocks, and more.Links from the showAnna-Lena's personal site: alpopkes.com100 Days of Code episode: talkpython.fm/186Anna-Lena on Github: github.comPyCon talk from Lisa Road (2018) - ‚ÄúDemystifying the patch function‚Äù: youtube.comPyCon talk from Edwin Jung (2019) - Mocking and Patching Pitfalls: youtube.comKeynote talk ‚ÄúFinding Magic in Python‚Äù (about magical universeproject): youtube.comBlog post about mocking in Python: alpopkes.comStackoverflow post on difference between stubs and mocks: stackoverflow.comFreezegun project: github.comKI Macht Schule (AI goes to school): ki-macht-schule.deCode Combat: codecombat.comPDB++: github.comSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebasti√°n Ram√≠rez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Imagine a unified search engine for everything personal in your life such as twitter, photos, google docs, todoist, goodreads, and more, all in once place and outside of cloud companies.On this episode we talk with Simon Willison who created both of these projects.

DEV Community,https://dev.to,Go Struct,https://dev.to/johnleoclaudio/go-struct-3p48,"Go lets you create your own data type using structs. If you're coming from TypeScript, you can think of it like an interface where you declare your fields and specify each type.type User struct {    name string    age int}To access values, use dot notation. Here's an example to use it:// variable user1 is now a type Useruser1 := User{    name: ""Scott"",    age: 23,}// Display the values:fmt.Println(""Name"", user1.name)fmt.Println(""Age"", user1.age)Here are some gotchas:type bob struct {        name string        age  int}type annie struct {        name string        age  int}var b bobvar a annieb = a // &lt;- cannot use a (variable of type annie) as bob value in assignmentAlthough the bob and annie structs have the same fields, assigning the variable b with a won't work because Go doesn't do implicit conversion . You CAN assign a to b though, using explicit conversionb = bob(a)What do you think will happen in the code below? Will the compiler complain?user2 := struct {        name string        age  int}{        name: ""Ishin"",        age:  72,}b = user2a = user2Surprisingly, the code above works. Why this works and not the previous one? It's because variable a was a named type and variable user2 is a literal type.Key Takeaways:Structs lets you create your own data typeUse explicit conversion to assign values with same memory footprint",2021-03-09T14:56:38Z,#datascience #tutorials
