Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Low Friction Data Governance With Immuta - Episode 164,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/immuta-data-governance-episode-164/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"Data governance is a term that encompasses a wide range of responsibilities, both technical and process oriented. One of the more complex aspects is that of access control to the data assets that an organization is responsible for managing. The team at Immuta has built a platform that aims to tackle that problem in a flexible and maintainable fashion so that data teams can easily integrate authorization, data masking, and privacy enhancing technologies into their data infrastructure. In this episode Steve Touw and Stephen Bailey share what they have built at Immuta, how it is implemented, and how it streamlines the workflow for everyone involved in working with sensitive data. If you are starting down the path of implementing a data governance strategy then this episode will provide a great overview of what is involved.",2020-12-21T23:10:14Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#286 Python and ML at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/286/python-and-ml-at-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-jpl,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field.

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#282 pre-commit framework,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/282/pre-commit-framework,"Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before committing your code. Hooks run on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as trailing whitespace and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks. As we created more libraries and projects we recognized that sharing our pre-commit hooks across projects is painful. That's why I'm happy to welcome Anthony Sottile to the show to discuss  pre-commit, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.Links from the showAnthony at Twitter: @codewithanthonypre-commit: pre-commit.compre-commit continuous integration: pre-commit.cipre-commit hooks: pre-commit.com/hooks.htmlpre-commit on GitHub: github.comshhgit secret discovery project: github.combabi editor: github.comTwitch stream: twitch.tvAnthony on GitHub: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-17T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
DEV Community,https://dev.to,My new coding workflow: VS Code + Remote-SSH extension,https://dev.to/jle/my-new-coding-workflow-vs-code-remote-ssh-extension-5fa3,"I recently rediscovered the ability of Visual Studio Code to develop on remote machines. Just connect to a server via SSH and develop there.Even though I'm using Git, I don't have to commit everything immediately to continue development on another machine, I don't have to take care to keep all my development tools up to date on all my machines, and I can continue working from my Surface Go with Windows exactly where I left off with my Ubuntu desktop. And I can, for example, start drafting a blog post on one computer, but finish it on another.All I need is a cheap rented virtual private server and Visual Studio Code on every machine I want to code from.But first of all the reason why I got the idea in the first place:To program in Go, I mainly used IDEA Ultimate from JetBrains in the past. The best IDE a developer can wish for. Excellent for Java, Kotlin, Go and a lot of other programming languages. And pretty cool: As a student you can get the full IDE for free.However, since I won't be a student forever and IDEA Ultimate or as an alternative just GoLand from JetBrains aren't very cheap (at least for hobby projects), I thought I might get used to a different workflow now that will cost me less money later.The second best option for developing Go is probably Visual Studio Code. The Go team took over the development of the Go extension not too long ago, which will hopefully make it more and more pleasant to develop Go programs with VS Code in the future.VS Code is free, partly even open source and I already use it for quite a lot of things anyway, be it for writing longer blog articles or if I need to write some JavaScript. In itself it is just a text editor, but there are quite a few extensions that add all kinds of functionality. And VS Code is fast and available for all three major computer operating systems.For VS Code there is an extension called ""Remote - SSH"" (documentation is available here) with which it is possible to connect to another computer or server via SSH. On the remote computer VS Code installs a remote server to provide almost all functionality that is possible locally. It's like running VS Code directly on the remote computer and developing from there.As a server I use the cheapest option from Hetzner Cloud. With just a few clicks I created a VPS with Ubuntu 20.04, two Gigabytes of RAM and 20 GB SSD storage. I also use Ubuntu 20.04 on my desktop computer and laptop, the environment I am used to. And if the server should be too weak for certain tasks, I can scale it up with a few clicks, even temporarily. The costs are 2,89 € per month. If I don't need the server for a longer period of time, I could also create an image of the hard drive, delete the server and create a new one later based on the image. That would cost only a few cents per month.This way I only have to install all the tools I need on the server. Like Go for the programming of various private projects or Hugo for this blog and my website. But I don't have to install these tools on all my devices anymore, namely my desktop computer, my Ubuntu-ThinkPad and my Surface Go. There I only need Visual Studio Code with the ""Remote - SSH"" extension.It definitely takes some getting used to in order to adapt to the less comfort you might be used to through the JetBrains IDE. But once you have found the right settings of the Go extension (for example that the Go language server gopls is used), then programming with this setup works quite well.My favorite feature is definitely the ability to forward ports from the server to the local machine.The only possible negative point is that I need an internet connection to develop so that I can connect to the server. But so often I am not without internet and even in Germany the mobile network should be sufficient for SSH. And when I am offline, I will just have to do something else.",2021-01-02T10:49:00Z,#datascience #tutorials
DEV Community,https://dev.to,Accessible Circular Sliders,https://dev.to/madsstoumann/accessible-circular-sliders-11p,"Just a few years ago, it was almost impossible to create range sliders without a lot of JavaScript. Thankfully, in modern browsers, it's super-easy to style range sliders, using CSS only. If the browser supports CSS Custom Properties, it's even possible to use the same styles for a wide range of different styles, just by updating a few properties.I created these sliders recently, using only CSS:JavaScript is only used to set the value of the slider as a custom property, that then is used in a CSS linear-gradient to create the ""fill"".Accessibility is ""built-in"": you can :focus, and use arrow-keys for navigation.      But what about Circular Sliders?I've always had a soft spot for circular sliders — don't know why, really. So I tried to style the &lt;input type=""range"" /&gt; as a circle, and the thumb-shadow-element as a draggable, smaller circle.Visually, it was possible using only CSS:But the movement of the thumb-circle was still horizontal. I then tried to update a custom property with the value of the &lt;input&gt;, and used that in a transform, rotating the track of the &lt;input&gt; and a negative margin-left to position the thumb.But, alas, although it was possible to move the thumb along the edges of the circle using arrow-keys, it didn't really work using pointer-devices.So in the end, I had to call my father, a retired maths teacher, to brush up my trigonometry and understanding of arctangents, in order to create these accessible, circular sliders:They are :focus'able, and use the same arrow-keys as regular range-sliders. The fill is a CSS conic-gradient.Thanks for reading!",2021-01-02T16:45:39Z,#datascience #tutorials
