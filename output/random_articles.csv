Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#273 CoCalc: A fully colloborative notebook development environment,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/273/cocalc-a-fully-colloborative-notebook-development-environment,"Everyone in the Python space is familiar with Notebooks these days. One of the original notebook environments was SageMath. Created by William Stein, and collaborators, it began as an open-source, Python-based, computational environment focused on mathematicians. It has since grown into a full-blown company and has become a proper collaborative environment for things like Jupyter notebooks, Linux-backed Bash shells, and much more. Think Google Docs but across all these facets of development in your browser.We welcome back William Stein to give us an update on his journey from professor to entrepreneur building CoCalc along the way.Links from the showWilliam on Twitter: @wstein389CoCalc: cocalc.comEpisode 59 about SageMath: talkpython.fm/59Comparing CoCalc to other products: cocalc.comExamples/Gallery: share.cocalc.comSageMath: sagemath.orgX11 server: xpra.orgSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-18T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#280 Python and AI in Journalism,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/280/python-and-ai-in-journalism,"If there has ever been a time in history that journalism is needed to shine a light on what's happening in the world, it's now. Would it surprise you to hear that Python and machine learning are playing an increasingly important role in discovering and bringing us the news? On this episode, you'll meet Carolyn Stansky, a journalist and developer who's been researching this intersection.Links from the showCarolyn on Twitter: @carolstranCarolyn on LinkedIn: linkedin.comCarolyn's site: workwithcarolyn.comCarolyn's talk: How AI is enhancing journalism: vimeo.comExamples of AI / automation in useQuakebot: bit.ly/quakebot-codeLA Homicide Tracker: homicide.latimes.comreportermate: github.comBuzzfeed Finding and tracking secret spy planes: bit.ly/buzzfeed-spy-planesNY Times comment moderation: bit.ly/nyt-commentsAl Jazzira: Drones in warzones: bit.ly/fmls-keynoteToolsQz.ai - Quartz AI Studio, focused on helping smaller papers and journalists: qz.aiFacets: github.ioGoogle News Initiative: bit.ly/google-niNewspaper3k Package: newspaper.readthedocs.ioFiveThirtyEight: fivethirtyeight.comGoogle News and Australia fight: bbc.comTwitter thread on American news overwhelming other countries: twitter.comSponsorsBrilliantTalk Python Training",2020-09-05T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#276 Geekout: Life in the solar system and beyond,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/276/geekout-life-in-the-solar-system-and-beyond,"We're back with another GeekOut episode. Richard Campbell, a developer and podcaster who also dives deep into science and tech topics, is back for our second GeekOut episode. Last time we geeked out about the real science and progress around a moon base. This time it's why is there life on Earth, where could it be or have been in the solar system, and beyond. In case you didn't catch the first GeekOut, episode 253, this one is more of a general science and tech episode. I love digging into the deep internals of all the tools of the Python space, but given all that is going on in the world, I thought it'd be fun to take a step back and just enjoy some fun geekery and give you all something to just sit back and let your mind dream.Links from the showRichard on Twitter: @richcampbellAll Richard's GeekOut Episodes: geekout.showMoonbase Geekout Episode: talkpython.fm/253High Altitude Venus Operational Concept (HAVOC): sacd.larc.nasa.govNew Horizons: solarsystem.nasa.govThe Planets: Saturn - NOVA documentary (Cassini): pbs.orgMission to Jupiter - Galileo: jpl.nasa.govSponsorsBrilliantTalk Python Training",2020-08-06T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#278 Teach kids Python with real programming and fun games at Code Combat,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/278/teach-kids-python-with-real-programming-and-fun-games-at-code-combat,"If there is one message I've been pushing across all of the Talk Python episodes, it's that programming is a superpower. Rather than all of us abandoning what we're interested in and becoming CS majors, we can take our passion or expertise and 10x it with a little programming skill. In that case, we should be teaching kids fluency in programming at a younger age. And yet, almost every platform or example meant to do so pulls its punches. We'll teach kids programming concepts but not code itself. That's a bridge too far.But it's not! That's why I'm excited about Code Combat. It's an online coding platform that uses real Python syntax to guide your hero, visually, through a dungeon full of challenges. Yet the editor and customized error messages mean this is approachable for kids before they can even type reliably.On this episode, we'll meet Nick Winter, one of the cofounders of Code Combat. There's a lot of philosophy behind the tool and technology to make it kid-friend and real Python at the same time.Oh, and it's running Python in the browser.Links from the showCodeCombat: codecombat.comOn TwitterCode Combat: @CodeCombatNick Winter: @nwinterNick's website: nickwinter.netCode Combat on GitHub: github.com/codecombatBrett's learnable programming talk: worrydream.comOzaria: ozaria.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
