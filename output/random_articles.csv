Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Building A Self Service Data Platform For Alternative Data Analytics At YipitData - Episode 163,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/yipitdata-alternative-data-analytics-episode-163/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"As a data engineer you're familiar with the process of collecting data from databases, customer data platforms, APIs, etc. At YipitData they rely on a variety of alternative data sources to inform investment decisions by hedge funds and businesses. In this episode Andrew Gross, Bobby Muldoon, and Anup Segu describe the self service data platform that they have built to allow data analysts to own the end-to-end delivery of data projects and how that has allowed them to scale their output. They share the journey that they went through to build a scalable and maintainable system for web scraping, how to make it reliable and resilient to errors, and the lessons that they learned in the process. This was a great conversation about real world experiences in building a successful data-oriented business.",2020-12-15T01:50:53Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

You can visualize the APIs with the smooth scalability taking to the mobile apps. You can see how, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime. What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form and integrating mail capabilities just for this purpose. Or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.Don't worry, we got you covered. Our guests, Christos Matskas and John Patrick Dandison are here to cover a bunch of different libraries and techniques we can use for adding identity to our Python applications.Links from the showChristos on Twitter: @christosmatskasJohn Patrick Dandison on Twitter: @azureandchillshhgit live: shhgit.comTwitch channel for Christos and JP: twitch.tv/425showPasslib & Folding: passlib.readthedocs.ioMicrosoft Authentication Library: github.com/AzureADauthlib - JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption draft implementation: github.comdjango-allauth - Authentication app for Django that ""just works"": github.comdjango-oauth-toolkit - OAuth 2 goodies for Django: github.compython-oauth2 - A fully tested, abstract interface to creating OAuth clients and servers: github.compython-social-auth - An easy-to-setup social authentication mechanism: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-26T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

One of the original notebook environments was SageMath. Created by William Stein, and collaborators, it began as an open-source, Python-based, computational environment focused on mathematicians. It has since grown into a full-blown company and has become a proper collaborative environment for things like Jupyter notebooks, Linux-backed Bash shells, and much more. Think Google Docs but across all these facets of development in your browser.We welcome back William Stein to give us an update on his journey from professor to entrepreneur building CoCalc along the way.Links from the showWilliam on Twitter: @wstein389CoCalc: cocalc.comEpisode 59 about SageMath: talkpython.fm/59Comparing CoCalc to other products: cocalc.comExamples/Gallery: share.cocalc.comSageMath: sagemath.orgX11 server: xpra.orgSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-18T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,7 GitHub Repositories To Help You Crush Your Job Interviews,https://dev.to/dailydotdev/7-github-repositories-to-help-you-crush-your-job-interviews-4fkc,"""In tech, interviews are harder than the actual jobs"". This is a joke, but it can be true in many cases. Thus, in this article, you will see 7 GitHub repositories that will help you ace the interviews.These repositories include information about:How the web works (DNS, HTTP, and many more subjects)Data Structures and AlgorithmsHow to design large-scale systems (System Design)Application SecurityJavaScript Algorithms      1. Coding Interview UniversityThe Coding Interview repository is one of the most comprehensive resources for interview preparation. The repository started as a study plan of the repository owner, which he used to become a software engineer.In this repository, you can find information about Data Structures, Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Design Patterns and more.I recommend you to check the repository here and explore it on your own. Be aware that it's comprehensive and you do not have to learn everything or everything at once. Nonetheless, the resource is extremely handy to prepare for interviews.      2. Tech Interview HandbookAnother useful resource is the Tech Interview Handbook. It covers information about technical interviews but not only. It also covers the job application (resume, cover letter), the interview process (behavioural questions, what questions to ask in the interview), and the post-interview (negotiation).Thus, you learn more than just Data Structures, Algorithms and other technical subjects. The Tech Interview Handbook is a handy resource, and I encourage you to check it here.      3. The System Design PrimerFor small side projects, we might get away without planning or too much thinking. However, building large-scale systems is a different game. Learning how to design scalable systems will help you become a software engineer.Thus, the System Design Primer repository is a collection of materials and resources from the internet. The owner of the repository put together resources and materials from different sources. Besides, the repository is continuously updated, so keep an eye on it!The repo contains a study guide, how to approach system design questions, and solutions to the questions. I highly recommend it, and I use it as well to learn more about designing scalable applications.      4. Interview ResourcesThe Interview repository does not have a description or a guide on how you should use it. It only lists links to other resources, and it groups these links by their topic. For instance, there is the Algorithms section that includes:BooksCoding PracticeGuidesMiscI like this repository in particular, because of the number of resources included. Also, I like that they are categorised by type. Besides that, it deserves an extra point for having similar repositories at the end. That is additional resources to prepare for your interviews. Do check out the repository!      5. How To Secure AnythingSecurity was, is, and will always be an essential topic when building applications. If your applications are not secure, it can result in disastrous consequences.Therefore, security is not something to take lightly. As a result, here we have the repository How To Secure Anything. The nice thing about this repository is that the information applies to securing anything, not only applications. The repository owner claims to ""aim to document a process for securing anything, whether it's a medieval castle, an art museum, or a computer network"".The repository is very well laid-out, and it includes a lot of extra materials to supplement your learning. I cannot recommend it enough!      6. How The Web WorksIn the interview for my first developer job, I was asked: what happens when you type a URL in a browser?. Probably, you encountered the same question, or maybe you will in the future.Thus, you can find the answer to such questions in the repo called How Web Works. You can find information about how DNS, HTTP protocol and server work or about DOM Tree, Render Tree, page painting and so on.It is a handy repository to learn the basics of how the web works. Moreover, the repository includes additional links to explore some subjects in-depth.      7. JavaScript AlgorithmsThe JavaScript Algorithms repository is more tailored to JavaScript positions. Although, if you understand the concepts, and know how to implement them in JavaScript, you will most likely know how to implement them in other languages too.Each Data Structure and Algorithm comes with its separate README, and it also includes links to further material. Thus, if you do not understand a concept, you can always follow the additional material for extra information.Although I want to mention that some information might be scarce, and you might need additional learning material; nonetheless, the repository is excellent to practice Algorithms and Data Structures.      ConclusionI hope these resources help you ace your next technical interview. The resources from the article are super helpful; especially if you use them together.The list from the article is not exhaustive, but it should cover anything you might encounter in an interview. As always, I am open to suggestions. Thus, if you know other great resources, feel free to drop them in the comments!daily.dev delivers the best programming news every new tab. We will rank hundreds of qualified sources for you so that you can hack the future.",2020-12-14T15:34:16Z,#datascience #tutorials

DEV Community,https://dev.to,7 Mindfulness Exercises Developers Can Do Every Day,https://dev.to/simonme/7-mindfulness-exercises-developers-can-do-every-day-8pl,"Your mind is busy.Sometimes you don’t hear your own thoughts or notice how you feel.Then again, other times, your thoughts are so clear that you notice every single thought coming and going.This second state is called mindfulness.Mindfulness means maintaining a gentle moment-to-moment awareness of your thoughts, bodily sensations, and surroundings, without judging anything.Being mindful makes me calmer, happier, more accepting, more focused, and improves my creative thinking. So all in all a much more fulfilling private and work life.Luckily, you can train yourself to have this state of mind more often. The key to this are mindfulness exercises that bring your mind back to the present moment.Here are 7 practical mindfulness exercises for software engineers.      Smile and BreatheThe breath is the basis for a lot of mindfulness techniques.It is always there. When you learn to use it as an anchor you’ll always have something to place your focus on. It gets you back into the most powerful time: now.Exercise: sit (or stand) upright. Make a relaxed focus with your eyes, or close them entirely. Then breathe in and smile. Calmly and steadily breathe out. Keep your smile. Keep at it for one or two minutes.This is just one of many breathing techniques. I’ll write an article on mindful breathing in the future.“The wisest one-word sentence? Breathe.” – Terri Guillemets      Body ScanDo you always notice what’s going on in your body?I don’t.Sometimes I notice a tension in my neck or shoulders and wonder how long it’s been there. But it’s a great feeling to notice a tension and then let it go.Exercise: you can do this in any comfortable position. Start at the top of your head and gently scan down to your toes. You can do this fast multiple times, or one time slowly. Don’t try to change anything while scanning. Only notice.      Mindful StretchingIf you’re doing any kind of sports, it’s a great idea to do some stretching after each session.Stretching itself is great for your body, and with a focus on mindfulness you can increase its relaxing effect on the mind.Exercise: the next time you stretch after physical activity, focus on two things: breathing deep and slowly, and letting go of all tensions. Afterwards notice how you feel. Try to take this feeling with you throughout the day      Body Symmetry ExerciseDo you have neck tensions sometimes?For me, there is always one side worse than the other.Here’s a mindful exercise that connects you with your body, brings you into the present moment, and maybe helps you relax a little bit.Exercise: you can do this when standing or sitting. Get in an upright position and, without a mirror, try to get your body symmetrical (not leaning to one side, and tension is the same in any area on both sides). I always start with my head, go down through the body, and iterate a few times. When you’ve found a position that feels good stay there for 10 breaths.If you’re getting used to this exercise, you’ll notice more often when you’re sitting lopsided at your desk and can fix this.Pro tip: do this exercise in front of a mirror with your eyes closed. When you’re content that you’re 100% symmetrical open your eyes. The result may surprise you.      Smell-Taste-FeelI’m sure you’re drinking coffee from time to time. Or tea.A drink with flavor offers yet another possibility to come back to the present moment. You can do this little exercise multiple times a day, in less than a minute.Exercise: When drinking a cup of your favorite beverage, before drinking take a few moments to smell it. How does this smell make you feel? Then take a sip. How does it taste, can you discover something new? When drinking, does it change how you feel generally? Maybe you have a warm feeling in your belly, or you feel more energetic.      Color ExerciseThis is a fun little exercise to notice your surroundings. Even in my own appartment I’m not always aware of everything that’s around me.Exercise: notice 10 things with a specific color that you can see. Look around. Can you spot 10 green things? Repeat this for a handful of colors. Bonus points if you’re breathing calmly and deeply.      Breathe-Smile-StretchWhen you’re happy, you smile. But did you know that this also works the other way around? Smiling can make you happy.Exercise: start breathing in and smile brighter and brighter. Keep your smile when breathing out. Then stretch your arms upward and repeat.      Do Small Steps Every DayMindfulness is a journey.For me, it is one path to a more happier, healthier life. It helps me to think clearer. According to research (and my personal experience) it reduces stress and anxiety.And like all journeys, it’s not one giant leap.It’s many, many small steps.Enjoy the scenery.The best way to capture moments is to pay attention. This is how we cultivate mindfulness. — Jon Kabat-ZinnInterested in more mindfulness for developers? Check out my weekly newsletter called Nerdful Mind.",2020-12-14T21:05:58Z,#datascience #tutorials
