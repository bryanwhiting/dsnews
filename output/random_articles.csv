Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#307 Python from 1994 to 2021, my how you've grown!",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/307/python-from-1994-to-2021-my-how-youve-grown,"Python has changed a lot since its inception 30 years ago. On this episode, you'll meet Paul Everitt and Barry Warsaw. They have both been involved with Python since the very first Python conference (called SPAM1 even). We discuss how it's changed but also how so many of the pressures and ideas from the very early days are still playing out in 2021. I'm sure you'll enjoy all the stories and reminiscing.Links from the showPaul on Twitter: @paulweverittBarry on Twitter: @pumpichankEpisode live stream: youtube.comA Python Developer Explores Apple's M1 video: youtube.comLet's Build a Fast, Modern Python API with FastAPI webcast: youtube.comPython.org 1997: python.orgPython is eating the world: How one developer's side project became the hottest programming language on the planet: techrepublic.comSome of Barry's music: soundcloud.comBarry’s early history of Python slides from BayPiggies: slides.comBackstory and liner notes for the Zen of Python song: wefearchange.orgZen of Python song: youtube.comPyCon Ticket Giveaway: talkpython.fm/pycon2021SponsorsSquareLinodeTalk Python Training",2021-03-11T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#286 Python and ML at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/286/python-and-ml-at-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-jpl,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field. And he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chrismattmannChris at JPL: jpl.nasa.govNature: A vision for data science: nature.comOpen source at JPL: github.comApache Nutch: nutch.apache.org7 Minutes of Terror: The Challenges of Getting to Mars: youtube.comtqdm package: pypi.orgPanama Papers: wikipedia.orgSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-16T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#293 Learning how to learn as a developer,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/293/learning-how-to-learn-as-a-developer,"As software developers, we live in a world of uncertainty and flux. Do you need to build a new web app? Well maybe using Django makes the most sense if you've been doing it for a long time. There is Flask, but it's more mix and match being a microframework. But you've also heard that async and await are game changers and FastAPI might be the right choice. Whatever it is you're building, there is constant pressure to stay on top of a moving target. Learning is not something you do in school then get a job as a developer. No, it a constant and critical part of your career. That's why we all need to be good, very good, at it.Matt Harrison is back on Talk Python to talk to us about some tips, tricks, and even science about learning as software developers.Links from the showMatt on Twitter: @__mharrison__Matt's Learning Course (use code TALKPYTHON20 for 20% off): mattharrison.podia.comFriends of the show: talkpython.fm/friends-of-the-showStreamlit: streamlit.ioJupyter LSP: github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lspSponsorsBrilliantLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
