Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#280 Python and AI in Journalism,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/280/python-and-ai-in-journalism,"If there has ever been a time in history that journalism is needed to shine a light on what's happening in the world, it's now. Would it surprise you to hear that Python and machine learning are playing an increasingly important role in discovering and bringing us the news? On this episode, you'll meet Carolyn Stansky, a journalist and developer who's been researching this intersection.Links from the showCarolyn on Twitter: @carolstranCarolyn on LinkedIn: linkedin.comCarolyn's site: workwithcarolyn.comCarolyn's talk: How AI is enhancing journalism: vimeo.comExamples of AI / automation in useQuakebot: bit.ly/quakebot-codeLA Homicide Tracker: homicide.latimes.comreportermate: github.comBuzzfeed Finding and tracking secret spy planes: bit.ly/buzzfeed-spy-planesNY Times comment moderation: bit.ly/nyt-commentsAl Jazzira: Drones in warzones: bit.ly/fmls-keynoteToolsQz.ai - Quartz AI Studio, focused on helping smaller papers and journalists: qz.aiFacets: github.ioGoogle News Initiative: bit.ly/google-niNewspaper3k Package: newspaper.readthedocs.ioFiveThirtyEight: fivethirtyeight.comGoogle News and Australia fight: bbc.comTwitter thread on American news overwhelming other countries: twitter.comSponsorsBrilliantTalk Python Training",2020-09-05T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#273 CoCalc: A fully colloborative notebook development environment,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/273/cocalc-a-fully-colloborative-notebook-development-environment,"Everyone in the Python space is familiar with Notebooks these days. One of the original notebook environments was SageMath. Created by William Stein, and collaborators, it began as an open-source, Python-based, computational environment focused on mathematicians. It has since grown into a full-blown company and has become a proper collaborative environment for things like Jupyter notebooks, Linux-backed Bash shells, and much more. Think Google Docs but across all these facets of development in your browser.We welcome back William Stein to give us an update on his journey from professor to entrepreneur building CoCalc along the way.Links from the showWilliam on Twitter: @wstein389CoCalc: cocalc.comEpisode 59 about SageMath: talkpython.fm/59Comparing CoCalc to other products: cocalc.comExamples/Gallery: share.cocalc.comSageMath: sagemath.orgX11 server: xpra.orgSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-18T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#285 Dask as a Platform Service with Coiled,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/285/dask-as-a-platform-service-with-coiled,"If you're into data science, you've probably heard about Dask. It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters. While powerful, this may take some serious setup to execute in its full glory. That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson and others to launch a business to help Python loving data scientists run Dask workloads in the cloud. And they are here to tell us about they open-source foundation business.And they must be on to something, between recording and releasing this episode, they raised $5M in VC funding.Links from the showHugo on Twitter: @hugobowneMatthew on Twitter: @mrocklinCoiled: coiled.ioCoiled raised $5M in Sept: twitter.comA brief history of dask article: coiled.io/blogCoiled: Dask for Everyone, Everywhere: medium.comThe incredible growth of python: stackoverflow.blogGrowth updated (SO Trends current): insights.stackoverflow.comCoiled Youtube channel: youtube.comSnorkel package: pypi.orgSponsorsBrilliantMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-09T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#296 Python in F1 racing,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/296/python-in-f1-racing,"Quick: Name the 3 most advanced engineering organizations you can think of? Maybe an aerospace company such as SpaceX or Boeing come to mind. Maybe you thought of CERN and the LHC. But in terms of bespoke engineering capabilities, you should certainly put the F1 racing teams on your list. These organizations appear as 20-30 people on a race day shown on TV. But in fact, the number of people back at the home base doing the engineering work can be over 500 employees. Almost every tiny part you see on these cars as well as the tools to maintain them are custom-built.The engineering problems solved are immense. Would it surprise you to know that Python is playing a major role here? On this episode, you'll meet Joe Borg who help pioneer Python's adoption at several F1 teams.Links from the showJoe's website: josephb.orgJoe on Twitter: @joedborgRacing Point F1 team: racingpointf1.comScuderia Alpha Tauri F1 team: scuderiaalphatauri.comMicroK8s: microk8s.ioCharmed Kubernetes: ubuntu.com/kubernetesSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-12-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Blog – Machine Learning Mastery,https://machinelearningmastery.com,Ensemble Learning Algorithm Complexity and Occam’s Razor,https://machinelearningmastery.com/ensemble-learning-and-occams-razor/,"Occam&#8217;s razor suggests that in machine learning, we should prefer simpler models with fewer coefficients over complex models like ensembles. Taken at face value, the razor is a heuristic that suggests more complex hypotheses make more assumptions that, in turn, will make them too narrow and not generalize well. In machine learning, it suggests complex [&#8230;]The post Ensemble Learning Algorithm Complexity and Occam&#8217;s Razor appeared first on Machine Learning Mastery.",2020-12-20T18:00:24Z,#datascience #tutorials
