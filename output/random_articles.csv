Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job, and hoping things work out, maybe you should start with a side-hustle. On this episode, you'll meet Keith McCormick, a data scientist who has many irons in the fire and he's here to tell us about different types of side hustles and why you may want to try or avoid one.Links from the showKeith on Twitter: @kmccormickblogKeith on LinkedIn: linkedin.comKeith's courses: linkedin.comSide Hustle Strategies for Data Science and Analytics Experts course: linkedin.com/learningTalk Python's Excel to Python course: talkpython.fm/excelSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-11-13T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
