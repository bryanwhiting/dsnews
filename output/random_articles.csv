Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#306 Scaling Python and Jupyter with ZeroMQ,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/306/scaling-python-and-jupyter-with-zeromq,"When we talk about scaling software threading and async get all the buzz. And while they are powerful, using asynchronous queues can often be much more effective. You might think this means creating a Celery server, maybe running RabbitMQ or Redis as well. What if you wanted this async ability and many more message exchange patterns like pub/sub. But you wanted to do zero of that server work? Then you should check out ZeroMQ.  ZeroMQ is to queuing what Flask is to web apps. A powerful and simple framework for you to build just what you need. You're almost certain to learn some new networking patterns and capabilities in this episode with our guest Min Ragan-Kelley to discuss using ZeroMQ from Python as well as how ZeroMQ is central to the internals of Jupyter Notebooks.Links from the showMin on Twitter: @minrkSimula Lab: simula.noTalk Python Binder episode: talkpython.fm/256The ZeroMQ Guide: zguide.zeromq.orgBinder: mybinder.orgIPython for parallel computing: ipyparallel.readthedocs.ioMessaging in Jupyter: jupyter-client.readthedocs.ioDevWheel Package: pypi.orgcibuildwheel: pypi.orgYouTube Live Stream: youtube.comPyCon Ticket Contest: talkpython.fm/pycon2021SponsorsLinodeMitoTalk Python Training",2021-03-05T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#285 Dask as a Platform Service with Coiled,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/285/dask-as-a-platform-service-with-coiled,"If you're into data science, you've probably heard about Dask. It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters. While powerful, this may take some serious setup to execute in its full glory. That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson and others to launch a business to help Python loving data scientists run Dask workloads in the cloud. And they are here to tell us about they open-source foundation business.And they must be on to something, between recording and releasing this episode, they raised $5M in VC funding.Links from the showHugo on Twitter: @hugobowneMatthew on Twitter: @mrocklinCoiled: coiled.ioCoiled raised $5M in Sept: twitter.comA brief history of dask article: coiled.io/blogCoiled: Dask for Everyone, Everywhere: medium.comThe incredible growth of python: stackoverflow.blogGrowth updated (SO Trends current): insights.stackoverflow.comCoiled Youtube channel: youtube.comSnorkel package: pypi.orgSponsorsBrilliantMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-09T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#282 pre-commit framework,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/282/pre-commit-framework,"Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before committing your code. Hooks run on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as trailing whitespace and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks. As we created more libraries and projects we recognized that sharing our pre-commit hooks across projects is painful. That's why I'm happy to welcome Anthony Sottile to the show to discuss  pre-commit, a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.Links from the showAnthony at Twitter: @codewithanthonypre-commit: pre-commit.compre-commit continuous integration: pre-commit.cipre-commit hooks: pre-commit.com/hooks.htmlpre-commit on GitHub: github.comshhgit secret discovery project: github.combabi editor: github.comTwitch stream: twitch.tvAnthony on GitHub: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-17T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,My Journey with Dublin Maker Podcasts so far,https://dev.to/whykay/my-journey-with-dublin-maker-podcasts-so-far-34j4,"It's been a year since lockdown and my job as Dublin Maker Advocate was challenging, mostly because my job is to engage with the community, and many a time in person and also visit where they are based. The moment of helplessness came over me as community engagement, people who are just as at a loss like myself on what to do, postponement of the Dublin Maker festival to this year... ...but it will be a virtual event this summer. 🙌Here's a video of what the annual Dublin Maker festival is like every summer.And it has not rained in the park since their inception in 2012! So how do I/we bring Makers and community together during this period? One of the things the team talked about was creating a podcast and chatting with our Dublin Maker community. Let's bring those chats that are normally done in the tents in the park at the festival right to people's ear buds! 🎧First of all, I have to say, transcribing is hard, and due to time of turnarounds of the podcasts, I stopped transcribing, but I have started to do chapter markers via Buzzsprout.So if there's someone who would like to transcribe the podcasts for us, drop us an email at info@dublinmaker.ie, we really appreciate your help as this takes time and effort to do right.      Our podcastsWe have 2 series now, which is amazing! Six episodes so far in each. Topics covered range fromCraft dioramas/cosplaySTEAM activities with younger audienceOvercoming Covid-19's lockdown and running virtual events (including making it accessible to as many people as possible)Music (synth and guitar pedals)Hacking and doing experiments (webcams, custom controllers, LEGO!)Punk Microscopy &amp; jelly fish!Working and engaging with the communityBeing a Maker 😊You get to hear all the ups and downs, tips and tricks. And it was nice to catch up with our Maker friends who normally participate and showcase what they do at Dublin Maker each year.Production-wise, I get to re-live the chats as I edit them on Garageband and publishing them on Buzzsprout when they are ready.Most of the 1st series were uploaded to Dublin Maker's Youtube Channel but it wasn't getting as much listens (maybe because it's just a still graphic instead of a video of people chatting or animations, I didn't have time for latter). Could be something to think of if there's more time set aside on creating animations or just straight up recording the video (it's done through zoom anyway) and just upload the podcast video (with some editing, of course, as it's not live). 😉I really did try to make sound waves move (visualiser) to the audio, it's not as simple as I thought it would be, even tried Motion... it didn't work out the way I wanted. And I don't have After Effects. So I left that experiment behind!So the upside for me is that I get to chat Makers and friends again, and we get to share our conversations with our wider community. 🙌The downside is I couldn't chat with them in-person. 😭BUT... we would love to chat more with other Makers, who should we invite next? The only caveat is that the guest will have participated or will be participating in the Dublin Maker festival.So email us at info@dublinmaker.ie and we will be in touch.And here's my podcast sign off... 🎵 cuts in""Remember to like and subscribe.

My answer to this question is usually something along the lines 'just go with the version your favorite tutorial was written in, and check out the differences later on.'\ But what if you are starting a new project and have the choice to pick? I would say there is currently no 'right' or 'wrong' as long as both Python 2.7.x and Python 3.x support the libraries that you are planning to use. However, it is worthwhile to have a look at the major differences between those two most popular versions of Python to avoid common pitfalls when writing the code for either one of them, or if you are planning to port your project.",2014-06-01T09:00:00Z,#tech #engineering
