Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#278 Teach kids Python with real programming and fun games at Code Combat,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/278/teach-kids-python-with-real-programming-and-fun-games-at-code-combat,"If there is one message I've been pushing across all of the Talk Python episodes, it's that programming is a superpower. Rather than all of us abandoning what we're interested in and becoming CS majors, we can take our passion or expertise and 10x it with a little programming skill. In that case, we should be teaching kids fluency in programming at a younger age. And yet, almost every platform or example meant to do so pulls its punches. We'll teach kids programming concepts but not code itself. That's a bridge too far.But it's not! That's why I'm excited about Code Combat. It's an online coding platform that uses real Python syntax to guide your hero, visually, through a dungeon full of challenges. Yet the editor and customized error messages mean this is approachable for kids before they can even type reliably.On this episode, we'll meet Nick Winter, one of the cofounders of Code Combat. There's a lot of philosophy behind the tool and technology to make it kid-friend and real Python at the same time.Oh, and it's running Python in the browser.Links from the showCodeCombat: codecombat.comOn TwitterCode Combat: @CodeCombatNick Winter: @nwinterNick's website: nickwinter.netCode Combat on GitHub: github.com/codecombatBrett's learnable programming talk: worrydream.comOzaria: ozaria.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

In this episode Andrew Gross, Bobby Muldoon, and Anup Segu describe the self service data platform that they have built to allow data analysts to own the end-to-end delivery of data projects and how that has allowed them to scale their output. They share the journey that they went through to build a scalable and maintainable system for web scraping, how to make it reliable and resilient to errors, and the lessons that they learned in the process. This was a great conversation about real world experiences in building a successful data-oriented business.",2020-12-15T01:50:53Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

One of the more complex aspects is that of access control to the data assets that an organization is responsible for managing. The team at Immuta has built a platform that aims to tackle that problem in a flexible and maintainable fashion so that data teams can easily integrate authorization, data masking, and privacy enhancing technologies into their data infrastructure. In this episode Steve Touw and Stephen Bailey share what they have built at Immuta, how it is implemented, and how it streamlines the workflow for everyone involved in working with sensitive data. If you are starting down the path of implementing a data governance strategy then this episode will provide a great overview of what is involved.",2020-12-21T23:10:14Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,How to write an effective performance review,https://dev.to/rinaarts/how-to-write-an-effective-performance-review-449j,"Performance review season is upon us, and with it the dreaded self review. Many of us spend way too much time struggling with this task, how can we summarize our achievements in an appealing yet accurate way? SO MUCH STRESS. In the spirit of keeping the time and effort to a minimum, I’m sharing my tips on writing a stellar self-review, fast.Image by athree23 from Pixabay      Watch your languageIf english is not your first language, start by writing in the language you are most comfortable with. A lot of people struggle with getting started because the language is a barrier. Translate it after you’re done, it doesn’t matter if there are grammar mistakes — what’s important is to list your accomplishments.      Don’t be shySelf reviews are not the time to be modest, celebrate anything you did, big or small. This doesn’t mean everything you did is super important, but that leads us into the next tip:      StorytellingMany companies have career ladder guidelines and values, use those to decide what story you want to tell, but even if there are none, you should start by deciding what your narrative is, and then find proof.Let’s say the story you want to tell is “I’m an amazing mentor”. You’ll gather situations where you helped others out in a formal or informal setting. You’ll frame substantial code reviews or other conversations as mentoring.If your story is “I’m an amazing architect”, you’ll gather situations where you designed great software or had major input in other’s great designs, and you’ll frame conversations or code reviews as valuable technical input.This approach will get your message across more effectively and will take less time than trying to fit everything you did this year into your self review without a meaningful order (chronological order is not meaningful…).Note: this is not about making your achievements more than they are and definitely not about making things up — it’s about getting your message across effectively.      Take notesIf you have regular check-ins with your manager, use them as a reference. If not, and you aren’t doing this already — I recommend spending 5 minutes each week to summarize what you did, who you worked with and other “noteworthy” things. Save links to code and code reviews, documents and discussions you participated in. I also write the occasional note about people I worked with, in case they ask me to write a review of them.Image by StockSnap PixabayDoing this will make check-ins, performance reviews and even sprint retros easier to write, it’s definitely worth the effort (I’ve been doing it for the past two years…).Bonus: If you feel comfortable doing this and you have 360 reviews (i.e. your colleagues write reviews of you as well as your manager) you can send a summary of what you worked on to your colleagues just to remind them what you did. It will make it easier for them to write their review of you and they will appreciate it.If you’re a follower you’ll notice this is one of the shortest blog posts I’ve ever written — that’s just because I have my own set of reviews to write.Hope this helps and good luck!",2021-01-17T14:09:52Z,#datascience #tutorials
