Do you struggle loading large amounts of data or wonder what parts of your code use the maximum amount of memory? Maybe you just want to require smaller compute resources (servers, RAM, and so on).   If so, this episode is for you.

While there are a number of platforms available for building that catalog, many of them are either difficult to deploy and integrate, or expensive to use at scale. In this episode Grant Seward explains how he built Tree Schema to be an easy to use and cost effective option for organizations to build their data catalogs. He also shares the internal architecture, how he approached the design to make it accessible and easy to use, and how it autodiscovers the schemas and metadata for your source systems.",2020-11-10T02:48:31Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,How to write good documentation,https://dev.to/victoria/how-to-write-good-documentation-6i1,"If you‚Äôve ever half-written a software project before taking a few days off, this is the article you‚Äôll discover you needed when you reopen that IDE.In the technology teams I lead, we make a constant effort to document all the things. Documentation lives alongside the code as an equal player. This helps ensure that no one needs to make assumptions about how something works, or is calling lengthy meetings to gain working knowledge of a feature. Good documentation saves us a lot of time and hassle.That said, and contrary to popular belief, the most valuable software documentation is not primarily written for other people. As I said in this well-received tweet:                          Victoria Drake                    @victoriadotdev                                        The secret to good documentation is to write it while you're writing the code. You are your first audience. Explain what you're doing to yourself. Future you will thank you!              15:46 PM - 24 Nov 2020                                                      56                          308      With holidays around the corner, it‚Äôd be prudent to prepare for the possibility of some eggnog-induced programming paralysis. (Pecan pie and Python make a great combination.) ü•ßüêçHere are three concrete steps you can take to write good documentation before it‚Äôs too late.      1. Start with accurate notesAs you work out ideas in code, ensure you don‚Äôt soon forget important details by starting with accurate notes. While you will want to explain things to yourself in long-form later, short-form notes will suffice to capture details without interrupting your coding session flow.Keep a document open alongside your code and write down things like commands, decisions, and sources you use. This can include:Terminal commands you typed inWhy you chose a particular method over anotherLinks you visited for help or cough_copy-paste_cough inspirationThe order in which you did thingsDon‚Äôt worry about full sentences at this point. Just ensure you accurately capture context, relevant code snippets, and helpful URLs. It can also be helpful to turn on any auto-save option available.      2. Explain decisions in long formThe ideal time to tackle this step is when you take a break from coding, but before you completely go out to lunch on whatever it is you‚Äôre working on at the moment. You want to ensure that context, ideas, and decisions are all still fresh in your mind when you explain them to yourself.Go over the short-form notes you took and start expanding them into conversational writing. Be your own rubber duck. Describe what you‚Äôre doing as if you were teaching it to someone else. You might cover topics such as:Quirky-looking decisions: ‚ÄúI would normally do it this way, but I chose to do something different because‚Ä¶‚ÄùChallenges you ran into and how you overcame themArchitectural decisions that support your project goalsStick to the main points. Long-form writing doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôll be paid by the word! Just use full sentences, and write as if explaining your project to a colleague. You‚Äôre explaining to future you, after all.      3. Don‚Äôt neglect prerequisite knowledgeThis step is best done after a long lunch break, or even the next day (but probably not two). Re-read your document and fill in any blanks that become apparent after putting some distance between yourself and the project.Take extra care to fill in or at least link to prerequisite knowledge, especially if you frequently use different languages or tools. Even an action as small as pasting in a link to the API documentation you used can save hours of future searching.Write down or link to READMEs, installation steps, and relevant support issues. For frequently performed command-line actions, you can use a self-documenting Makefile to avoid having to man common tasks each time you come back to a project.It‚Äôs easy to forget supporting details after even just a short break from your project. Capture anything you found helpful this time around.      Document all the thingsThe next time you catch yourself thinking, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll remember this part, no need to write it down,‚Äù just recall this emoji: ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èSoftware projects are made up of a lot more than just their code. To best set up your future self for success, document all the things! Whether it‚Äôs a process you‚Äôve established, Infrastructure as Code, or a fleeting future roadmap idea ‚Äî write it down! Future you will thank you for it.If you enjoyed this post, I'd love to know. Join the thousands of people who learn along with me on victoria.dev!
