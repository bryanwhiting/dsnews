You can visualize the APIs with the smooth scalability taking to the mobile apps. You can see how, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime. What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form and integrating mail capabilities just for this purpose. Or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.Don't worry, we got you covered. Our guests, Christos Matskas and John Patrick Dandison are here to cover a bunch of different libraries and techniques we can use for adding identity to our Python applications.Links from the showChristos on Twitter: @christosmatskasJohn Patrick Dandison on Twitter: @azureandchillshhgit live: shhgit.comTwitch channel for Christos and JP: twitch.tv/425showPasslib & Folding: passlib.readthedocs.ioMicrosoft Authentication Library: github.com/AzureADauthlib - JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption draft implementation: github.comdjango-allauth - Authentication app for Django that ""just works"": github.comdjango-oauth-toolkit - OAuth 2 goodies for Django: github.compython-oauth2 - A fully tested, abstract interface to creating OAuth clients and servers: github.compython-social-auth - An easy-to-setup social authentication mechanism: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-26T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#293 Learning how to learn as a developer,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/293/learning-how-to-learn-as-a-developer,"As software developers, we live in a world of uncertainty and flux. Do you need to build a new web app? Well maybe using Django makes the most sense if you've been doing it for a long time. There is Flask, but it's more mix and match being a microframework. But you've also heard that async and await are game changers and FastAPI might be the right choice. Whatever it is you're building, there is constant pressure to stay on top of a moving target. Learning is not something you do in school then get a job as a developer. No, it a constant and critical part of your career. That's why we all need to be good, very good, at it.Matt Harrison is back on Talk Python to talk to us about some tips, tricks, and even science about learning as software developers.Links from the showMatt on Twitter: @__mharrison__Matt's Learning Course (use code TALKPYTHON20 for 20% off): mattharrison.podia.comFriends of the show: talkpython.fm/friends-of-the-showStreamlit: streamlit.ioJupyter LSP: github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lspSponsorsBrilliantLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
