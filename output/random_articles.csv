Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Building A Cost Effective Data Catalog With Tree Schema - Episode 158,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/tree-schema-data-catalog-episode-158/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"A data catalog is a critical piece of infrastructure for any organization who wants to build analytics products, whether internal or external. While there are a number of platforms available for building that catalog, many of them are either difficult to deploy and integrate, or expensive to use at scale. In this episode Grant Seward explains how he built Tree Schema to be an easy to use and cost effective option for organizations to build their data catalogs. He also shares the internal architecture, how he approached the design to make it accessible and easy to use, and how it autodiscovers the schemas and metadata for your source systems.",2020-11-10T02:48:31Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#278 Teach kids Python with real programming and fun games at Code Combat,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/278/teach-kids-python-with-real-programming-and-fun-games-at-code-combat,"If there is one message I've been pushing across all of the Talk Python episodes, it's that programming is a superpower. Rather than all of us abandoning what we're interested in and becoming CS majors, we can take our passion or expertise and 10x it with a little programming skill. In that case, we should be teaching kids fluency in programming at a younger age. And yet, almost every platform or example meant to do so pulls its punches. We'll teach kids programming concepts but not code itself. That's a bridge too far.But it's not! That's why I'm excited about Code Combat. It's an online coding platform that uses real Python syntax to guide your hero, visually, through a dungeon full of challenges. Yet the editor and customized error messages mean this is approachable for kids before they can even type reliably.On this episode, we'll meet Nick Winter, one of the cofounders of Code Combat. There's a lot of philosophy behind the tool and technology to make it kid-friend and real Python at the same time.Oh, and it's running Python in the browser.Links from the showCodeCombat: codecombat.comOn TwitterCode Combat: @CodeCombatNick Winter: @nwinterNick's website: nickwinter.netCode Combat on GitHub: github.com/codecombatBrett's learnable programming talk: worrydream.comOzaria: ozaria.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

If you are putting your workflows into production, then you need to consider how you are going to implement data security, including access controls and auditing. Different databases and storage systems all have their own method of restricting access, and they are not all compatible with each other. In order to simplify the process of securing your data in the Cloud Manav Mital created Cyral to provide a way of enforcing security as code. In this episode he explains how the system is architected, how it can help you enforce compliance, and what is involved in getting it integrated with your existing systems. This was a good conversation about an aspect of data management that is too often left as an afterthought.",2020-10-26T22:45:48Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,The Bootstrap Jamstack: How Indie Players Compete,https://dev.to/the_fln/the-bootstrap-jamstack-how-indie-players-compete-adb,"Jump to video version of this post. üé•Hey, I‚Äôm Franck. üëãI run a developer-first e-commerce solution, and I try my best to grow a healthy bootstrapped company. It‚Äôs called Snipcart, and we‚Äôre based in beautiful Qu√©bec.Our product is part of the Jamstack ecosystem. If you don‚Äôt know what that is, no worries. There‚Äôs a cool intro here.In a nutshell, ‚ÄúJamstack‚Äù is a modern, frontend-centric way to develop sites and apps. It focuses on decoupling backend from frontend, lowering maintenance and hosting costs, pushing static assets through CDNs, edge computing, and using JavaScript and APIs for everything dynamic. Big players include Netlify, Vercel, Contentful, and many others.Some indie companies I look up to in the space are DatoCMS, Fathom analytics and Statamic.I‚Äôm seeing lots of VC-funded businesses shining, but I‚Äôd love to see more bootstrappers alongside us.In this piece, I‚Äôll show how independent players can build, compete, and grow in the Jamstack ecosystem. I‚Äôll include real-life examples from the Snipcart team and other cool products.      Industry funding overviewWhen building businesses, there are often two commons paths for your success model: Bootstrapped companies focus on lifestyle and profitability. VC-backed companies focus on growth and valuation.Things aren‚Äôt so black and white anymore. Alternative funding solutions like TinySeed, Indie.vc, and Earnest Capital are making noise. Their nuanced approach deserves a post in itself.Let‚Äôs take two categories: e-commerce and headless CMS. I had wondered what the ratio of bootstrapped vs. funded was for these. So I took a look:Funding abounds in this Jamstack category. Snipcart is one of the only e-commerce players that made it past five years without funding.Here, the ratio appears more balanced. Why? I think e-commerce, as a product category, involves more inherent complexity.Headless CMS must handle APIs, data storage and retrieval, plugins, permissions, integrations, previews, etc. That‚Äôs a lot.But e-commerce solutions must handle most of the above plus tax management, shipping and fulfillment, emails, payment processing, refunds, security, discounts, multi-currencies, etc.E-commerce is also closer to the money. The complexity it addresses touches more critical parts of a user‚Äôs life than a CMS: security, identity, revenue, etc.Trying to solve for e-commerce might be harder, pushing teams to untie some knots through funding. What do you think?I quickly put together this Google Sheet. If you want me to update it, drop a comment, or send me an email. I might spin this into a cuter microsite‚Äînot sure yet!      A word on venture capitalMost of us have seen the loud Basecamp/37signals vs. VCs battle unfold over the past decade. It has, for better or worse, painted a very adversarial picture of the startup ecosystem.The boring reality is that venture capitalists aren‚Äôt as evil as some factions of the bootstrapped community claim. They are agents inside a flawed system with weird incentives and dynamics.Some companies require wide, horizontal adoption across multiple markets‚Äîthink infrastructure. The more you‚Äôre in that position, the more likely you‚Äôll need VC money to succeed. Netlify couldn‚Äôt have worked out the way it did without that kind of funding.The vital distinction peers helped me realize is that the notion of ‚Äúwinning‚Äù differs drastically on the VC and bootstrap path. An entrepreneur‚Äôs values and ambition will dictate which kind of success they want to achieve. And that‚Äôs fine. Here, I‚Äôll just be spreading the gospel that resonates best with me.      Why bring Jamstack &amp; bootstrapping together?We see indie communities in SaaS popping up all the time: Startups for the rest of us, Indie Hackers, etc. There's a reason for that: some people don't want to build companies inside the VC model's incentive and pressure structure.Raising money is a rollercoaster of emotions and intensity. It ultimately offers two paths of success: get acquired or go public. Before that, ""success"" is exiting a round for investors. You have people putting in money just to leave the company as soon as they can. When you put it like that, it does feel odd, right?The Jamstack ethos is filled with values we also see in the bootstrapped community:Independence üíÉIn Jamstack: freedom from monoliths, giants, incumbents, tools with poor DX.In bootstrap: freedom from corporate lifestyle, 9-5, boredom, location.Keeping things small üå±In Jamstack: no need for big architectures, hefty installs, heavy downloads.In bootstrap: no need for hundreds of millions in revenue, hundreds of employees, tens of thousands of customers. No need for excessive spending on vanity marketing.Price consciousness üí∏In Jamstack: no need to pay for a bunch of plugins, extravagant hosting, and maintenance. You can also rely on many free open source tools.In bootstrap: you gotta eat! Budget is limited, so spending wisely is extra essential.Performance sensibility üèéIn Jamstack: focus on critical user-centric metrics (FCP, TTI, etc.).In bootstrap: focus on critical business-centric metrics (profitability, churn, LTV) and human-centric metrics (happiness, sleep, financial comfort, free time, etc.).      How can independent Jamstack players compete?Cool cool, but I can‚Äôt compete with the Netlify, Contentful, Shopify in the space. They raised many millions! Hundreds of people work for them!Yes, you can. Others have done it. We have done it.The trick is in how you go about it!      Taming long-tailsWhen you‚Äôre bootstrapped, your economic incentives are drastically different from VC-funded businesses. They need market shares, steep growth, PR attention, multiple acquisition channels. You only need a small community, one sustainable acquisition channel, and enough customers to breakeven.Big players will often go after broad problems: Shopify wants to empower the whole world to sell online. Snipcart only wants to help a few hundred devs build better e-commerce stores.You see, the pains you solve with your product can be much more specific than bigger companies.I've got a parallel for you. If you're familiar with SEO (Search Engine Optimization), the term ""long-tails"" will ring a bell. When trying to drive organic traffic to their site, people often target very high volume keywords right away. Think ""headless CMS"". But the competition is super strong for such head terms. Big sites with high authority are battling on these SERPs (Search Engine Results Page).On the other hand, countless keywords are embodying narrower search intents out there. They have lower search volumes, true. But they are much easier to rank for, PLUS they come with more precise needs to solve‚Äî""how to read JSON files inside my Svelte app"".      Leveraging radical transparencyBootstrappers can‚Äôt hide behind corporate structures and policies. They are the business.It may feel scary at first, but you can turn this into an advantage using transparency and humility. People like to do business with people! That fact hasn‚Äôt changed in centuries.So embrace your smallness and personality inside your brand. Tell us your life story on your about page. Share the struggles of building your business publicly. Be warm and kind when dealing with customers. Tell jokes. Sometimes, being the only is better than being the best.All of that will foster proximity with your customers, which in turn will increase loyalty and word-of-mouth.      Building an audience firstIf you‚Äôre intent on creating a business to solve a problem, chances are you know a thing or two about said problem. You can share that knowledge and experience before you even start building.Adam Wathan and Steve Schoger have done similar things throughout different projects. They shared design tips on Twitter years before publishing paid projects like Refactoring UI or Tailwind UI.Or take developer Shawn Wang, who has been learning in public and sharing lessons for many months before launching his Coding Career Handbook.Many bootstrappers also share their early journey through podcasts, like Jon and Justin with Transistor, or Ben and Derrick with Tuple and SavvyCal.      Cushioning initial risks by launching inside an agencyIf you‚Äôre already working inside a web dev/design agency, there are cool opportunities to consider.One I like: leveraging a client case to build‚Äîand pay for‚Äîyour MVP. That's how we got started with Snipcart. We were upfront with the client about it: we'd make them a custom solution to circumvent their e-commerce challenges but would also re-use some of that code to build something ourselves. We gave them a discount and free usage + priority support for life.TakeShape, the headless CMS, followed a similar path early on.Doing initial product work inside the agency also lets you move faster, without administrative red tape. Once traction kicks in and product-market fit is on the horizon, you can slowly branch out. Your ‚Äúside product‚Äù can then become its own company.      Picking a fight (if you‚Äôre a fighter)Ugh, fights. Feels like they‚Äôre all over the Internet these days. We‚Äôve sure had our fair share of it with the recent WordPress vs. Jamstack one, hehe.Still, if you feel like you‚Äôve got that kind of energy, it‚Äôs a good way to help grow a bootstrapped business.First step is often choosing a nemesis: legacy solutions, category giants, specific competitors, or industry trends. You pick your Goliath, put on your David shoes, and start slingin‚Äô!The recent Basecamp/Hey vs. Apple fight is a good example here.Folks at Fathom analytics have also done a great job at fighting for a cause: privacy. It appeals to potential customers‚Äô strong values, enabling the creation of more solid bonds between business and audience.When you target the bigger guy, you can use their clout and traction (and their known pains) to fuel your growth:X is great but s*cks at THIS. We do THIS much better‚Äîtry us!      Open-sourcing firstThat‚Äôs another popular one in the Jamstack space.You‚Äôll see many CMS offering a free, open-source version of their software. They build community and traction around this, then offer a paid, hosted version, for instance. Ghost has done that.Other things you can sell around your free offering: support, integrations, plugins, related products.You can also invite the community to support you with sponsorships and donations. It can, for sure, absorb some of the early expenses you'll face when building your bootstrapped product!      Going firstMany tools and frameworks aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúJamstack-ready‚Äù yet.There's an opportunity to go first here. You can build Jamstack-specific products (plugins, APIs, integrations, frameworks, etc.) around or on top of existing tools: Gridsome lets you create better Jamstack sites with Vue.js JungleJS helps you build static sites with Svelte Udesly lets you convert your Webflow site to Jamstack Strattic enables static generation of WordPress sites      Betting on integrationsI‚Äôve been diving into the Jobs-to-be-done framework recently. A useful concept that stuck with me is knowing where your product ends and another one begins.That mental model is useful when bootstrapping. Ask yourself: what platform do people love except for X, or but they don‚Äôt do Y. These are opportunities for you to broadcast to an existing user base that your product can start there.On the flip side, you can also ask yourself: what tools do X better than my product? If you find compelling answers to this question, you might want to start integrating more tightly with these! Integrations let you profit from overlaps in audiences, plus they augment your feature set.In many cases, they also let you offload customer acquisition to existing marketplaces (think themes or plugin repos).      Meet successful independent Jamstack playersI hope that profiling these awesome companies will inspire many others. Something these businesses all share:They‚Äôre all players in the Jamstack space (and others)They‚Äôre all profitableThey‚Äôre all bootstrappedLet‚Äôs see which ways they chose to compete.      DatoCMSCool facts:5 people team‚Äîcomparable products hire 100+ people. over 1M ARR over 1500 paid customers worldwideVercel chose DatoCMS to manage content for Next.js conf.Competing using:Radical transparency: product journey retrospectives and proximity w/ agency clients.Agency launch: LeanPanda in Italy birthed what became DatoCMS.Betting on integrations: impressive marketplace of integrations.While researching this post, I spoke with founder Stefano Verna. Interesting tidbits from our conversation:For us, going bootstrap means being able to give your own definition of success, enjoy the journey, guarantee your customers a long life for your product and focus on a minimal and self-sustaining lifestyle and business.Today DatoCMS is made up of 5 people. We are a perfectly oiled machine that produces an absurd amount of value. It is literally impossible for us to believe that products that are absolutely comparable to ours have teams of +100 people. All I can think of is ""there must be some inefficiency somewhere"" :)[‚Ä¶] for those who have a technical team like us, I would suggest working hard on third-party integrations, so that you can lean on the shoulders of the giants and let them do marketing and customer acquisition for you.We have 1,600 customers all over the world, big names using us, stable and regular growth of 6% month-over-month, $1M ARR, we release a new, big feature per month. Just a few weeks ago Vercel chose us instead of the other 65 VC-based competitors for its 60,000 registrants Next.js Conf.      FathomCool facts:2 people team580.8% revenue growth in last year over 1,000,000,000 page views trackedCompeting using: Radical transparency: the founders (Paul and Jack) are ultra-transparent on their blog, podcast, social media, and customer support. Audience first: Paul Jarvis had already written Company of One. Jack Ellis had already been teaching Laravel. Pick a fight: they arguably have The Big G has a nemesis, and wave the flag of privacy and open web super high.Interesting tidbits from my email exchanges with the founders:We built it slowly and iteratively, so at the start we spent less time as it was making less money. Now, we are full-time because it makes ample revenue (enough to pay us both a salary and more) - so if we got, say a few million bucks investment, we'd have no use for it.[‚Ä¶] we have to consider everything from new features to pricing to infrastructure and ensure the maintenance costs of our growth doesn't make it harder to manage in the way we like.And, we are careful/thoughtful with new features so we don't overwhelm our support channel.      StatamicCompeting using: Radical transparency: one of the founders shares their journey on this podcast. Definitely embracing the ‚Äúnot the best but the only‚Äù w/ brand and positioning! Open source: The core product is free and open source. The Pro version is paid. Going first: Statamic was a flat-file pioneer. Betting on integrations: Huge marketplace.Interesting tidbits from my email exchanges with Jack McDade:Bootstrapping let us build the product I wanted, solve the pain points I (and others) had, and do it organically. It certainly is a slower way to grow, but that‚Äôs not a bad thing.Everything simply took longer. But it also gave us the ability to use the product differently and grow it more organically than if we hired a big team and fired up a few sprints. We could do things that didn‚Äôt scale, get to know customers closely, and build something that would last a long time.Statamic is used by Der Spiegel, one of the largest media and online publishing companies in Germany. It runs their largest sites. That‚Äôs a pretty big win for a small and scrappy bootstrapped company. Also in similar company: OpenTable, Asana, and Freshbooks.      SnipcartCool facts:9 people team1M ARRover 2300 paid customersCompeting using:   Long-tails: focus on smaller audience (devs, no enterprise). Only solving parts of e-commerce problem‚Äînot all of it. Radical transparency: blog posts, honest, no-BS customer support, interviews Agency launch: client project for MVP. We used √† la carte agency resources that we later refunded. Going first: we were arguably the firsts to market stack-agnostic e-commerce directly to developers.‚òùÔ∏è Tooting our own horn here, but I believe there are things to be learned from our journey to 1M ARR. The one lesson that hits home, especially as we scale a bit, is this:Saying no‚Äîand yes‚Äîto the right things is hard.All of the above are examples, not models. You need to scan your reality and come up with growth models that resonate with it. Occasionally, I mentor startups. I often advise leveraging their constraints. If you‚Äôre not a fighter, don‚Äôt pick a fight. If you don‚Äôt have an agency close to you, don‚Äôt go out of your way to find one. You get the idea.The Bootstrap Jamstack - Video      ClosingThe Jamstack community is one of the more dynamic and positive ones I‚Äôve seen. I‚Äôm thankful to be a part of it.If you, too, want to join in the fun, I urge you to. You can start by entering a Slack, a group, or by learning more. If you, too, fall in love with the ecosystem, then come back to this post and maybe start to build a new independent product. I‚Äôll be there to help in any way I can.I‚Äôd like to offer fellow bootstrappers some heuristics I have come to embrace:Most markets aren‚Äôt winner-take-all. Solve a problem differently, or different parts, and you‚Äôll generate real value.Success models are inspiration, not recipes. Lean on your strengths and into your constraints. You‚Äôll create your own authentic growth model.Millions in funding aren‚Äôt a pre-requisite to succeed in the Jamstack. Sustainable businesses can be built slowly, grown organically.If any of you are interested in creating a community for the bootstrap Jamstack, let me know. I have ideas (and domain names üòÖ).  I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts in the comments or on Twitter.Cheers! üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",2020-12-17T15:06:14Z,#datascience #tutorials
DEV Community,https://dev.to,"If it ain't got errors, break it!",https://dev.to/kirstybrews/if-it-ain-t-got-errors-break-it-6c4,"When I started my first coding project at Flatiron School, I got this feeling that I hadn't felt in a long time. It was this itch to keep coding because I was enjoying myself so much. I wanted to add more and more functionality to my project. I told friends and family that the last time I remembered having that feeling was when I played the saxophone in high school. Back then, I would practice everyday for hours on end, and nobody had to tell me to. I wanted to practice.I really started to progress in my playing abilities during my sophomore year. I didn't even notice until one day, while I was practicing some audition music, I heard outside my practice room, ""Who's that playing?"".A head poked through the door. ""Oh! You sound really good."" Not gonna lie, it felt really good to hear that and it did boost my confidence. But there's a fine line to walk between confidence and fear. At some point I started to develop the identity of a ""good"" saxophone player. To the point where I didn't allow myself to try and learn new things on saxophone because doing so would make me a beginner again and I'd be ""bad"" at playing my instrument. Unless it was something that was put in front of me that I had to learn how to play, I didn't venture out and learn new things. I didn't get creative. I was very rigid. Not surprisingly, playing the saxophone started to become less fun.When I was working on a mini coding project last week, I got all of my main deliverables to work. Great! I had some extra time, so I thought of trying things that were outside the scope of what I knew so far. Maybe I should try to add a login screen. Maybe I can work on the design and make this website look pretty. Maybe I can try to embed some videos on my website.Short of a few half-hearted attempts, I didn't try any of those things.Looking back at my project, I wish that I had ventured out and really tried out some of those ideas, even if they didn't work out in the end. Unfortunately, I had gotten that similar feeling of when I played the saxophone: I didn't want to be bad at coding. My code was working! Why mess with it?But I should've messed with it. That's the only way to get better. I have to keep reminding myself that it's okay to break my code. My classmates and I are reminded in class to view errors as the default for our code. If we see errors, that's a good thing! We're learning what to do and what not to do. And the errors are guiding us.I'm inspired by my classmates because I see them get creative and try new things. It's pushing me to do the same. You can't be creative if you're afraid of being wrong.I wish that I had learned this back when I was a little band nerd in high school. It would have probably prevented me from burning out. I was just too perfectionistic and I never allowed myself a day off from practicing. Now, when it comes to coding, I know to allow myself mental breaks and to allow myself to break things. Coding is way more fun that way.I still pick up my saxophone to play now and again, but now I just do it for the enjoyment. :)",2020-12-17T15:02:41Z,#datascience #tutorials

Category Submission:Random Roulette üïπÔ∏è      App Linkhttps://do-dev-hackaton-sv6sl.ondigitalocean.app/ - The URL is going to change in the future. I am, once again, having enormous problems choosing the perfect domain... I will make sure to edit my post when I pick the domain.       ScreenshotsThis is the screen when the game is started:This is the 'first-round' where everyone can still see the screen (the whole screen it a lot richer on details, this viewport is due to the 4 screens on 1 monitor):  This is what all the players see when it's the medic's round (explanation of the rules in the description):This is what the individual screens look like for the killer and the medic when they choose who to kill/heal:      DescriptionThe game is simply a murder mystery. I doubt it if the majority of the players haven't played this format before.      Rules:There is 1 killer, 1 medic, and the rest of the players are passengers. The goal is to find the killer through discussion. The rules go like this:Round 1 - The screen for everybody except for the killer goes off and the killer chooses his prey (who to kill).Round 2 - The screen for everybody except for the medic goes off and the medic chooses who to save.Round 3 - The screen for everybody comes clean and the results are shown: If nobody is killed, this means the medic managed to save the prey. If there is one killed, it means the medic could not save the prey. Everybody in the room discusses who to vote off and if they don't manage to catch the killer, the game continues looping through the next 3 rounds and so on.
