Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#285 Dask as a Platform Service with Coiled,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/285/dask-as-a-platform-service-with-coiled,"If you're into data science, you've probably heard about Dask. It's a package that feels like familiar APIs such as Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn. Yet it can scale that computation across CPU cores on your local machine all the way to distributed grid-based computing in large clusters. While powerful, this may take some serious setup to execute in its full glory. That's why Matthew Rocklin has teamed up with Hugo Bowne-Anderson and others to launch a business to help Python loving data scientists run Dask workloads in the cloud. And they are here to tell us about they open-source foundation business.And they must be on to something, between recording and releasing this episode, they raised $5M in VC funding.Links from the showHugo on Twitter: @hugobowneMatthew on Twitter: @mrocklinCoiled: coiled.ioCoiled raised $5M in Sept: twitter.comA brief history of dask article: coiled.io/blogCoiled: Dask for Everyone, Everywhere: medium.comThe incredible growth of python: stackoverflow.blogGrowth updated (SO Trends current): insights.stackoverflow.comCoiled Youtube channel: youtube.comSnorkel package: pypi.orgSponsorsBrilliantMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-09T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

One of the best ways to get a true understanding of how a technology works in practice is to hear from people who are running it in production. In this episode Zeeshan Qureshi and Michelle Ark share their experiences using DBT to manage the data warehouse for Shopify. They explain how the structured the project to allow for multiple teams to collaborate in a scalable manner, the additional tooling that they added to address the edge cases that they have run into, and the optimizations that they baked into their continuous integration process to provide fast feedback and reduce costs. This is a great conversation about the lessons learned from real world use of a specific technology and how well it lives up to its promises.",2021-02-09T01:43:41Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#286 Python and ML at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/286/python-and-ml-at-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-jpl,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field. And he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chrismattmannChris at JPL: jpl.nasa.govNature: A vision for data science: nature.comOpen source at JPL: github.comApache Nutch: nutch.apache.org7 Minutes of Terror: The Challenges of Getting to Mars: youtube.comtqdm package: pypi.orgPanama Papers: wikipedia.orgSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-16T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,How to Reduce RAM Consumption by 6X When Using ts-node,https://dev.to/aspecto/how-to-reduce-ram-consumption-by-6x-when-using-ts-node-4d8p,"It turns out that running ts-node-dev / ts-node is constantly consuming hundreds of megabytes of RAM even for small and simple applications.In development, it is usually not a big concern, however, it can be, if your application is running inside a docker container with limited resources (for example, with Docker Desktop on Mac which allocates by default only 2GB of RAM to all the containers in total).Typescript code should be transpiled to Javascript which can be done either before running the process (tsc) or in runtime (ts-node).The most efficient way is transpiling before running, however, this isn’t as developer-friendly since it takes forever. ts-node-dev loads everything into memory then watches the changes the developer is making and transpiles the project fast on every change.We encountered the issue while building a demo application to showcase our product at Aspecto.We were running multiple typescript services with docker-compose and started seeing arbitrary ts-node-dev processes exiting without even running the application, displaying the message “Done in 79.06s”.This was due to a lack of memory. Each typescript service was using ~600MB of RAM out of the total 2GB available for all containers.After digging a bit, we found a few possible solutions and wanted to share them.      Run ts-node-dev with option --transpile-onlyIn our case, adding the --transpile-only option to ts-node-dev reduced the consumed RAM from ~600MB to ~170MB.The price was that the typescript code would only be transpiled, and typechecking would be skipped. Most modern IDEs (vscode, web storm), has built-in typescript IntelliSense which highlights errors, so for us, it was a fair price to pay.If you use ts-node to run code in production that was already successfully compiled and tested in the CI, you can only benefit from setting this option.      Compile the code with tsc and monitor file changes with nodemonInstead of using ts-node-dev, which consumes a lot of memory, it is possible to compile the application directly with tsc and then run it from dist/build like this: node dist/index.js.For automatic reload on source file changes, nodemon / node-dev can be used.This is our “start” script in package.json:For automatic reload on source file changes, nodemon / node-dev can be used.This is our “start” script in package.json:""scripts"": {  ""start"": ""nodemon --watch src -e ts --exec \""(tsc &amp;&amp; node dist/index.js) || exit 1\""""}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This approach reduced the RAM on our service from ~600MB to ~95MB (but there was still a spike in RAM to 600Mb for few seconds while tsc was compiling).Unlink the previous option, this approach does check for typescript errors and warnings, and the service does not start if errors exist in the code.The price to pay here is a longer compilation time. In our setup, it’s about 10 seconds from saving the file until the service restarts.      Increase Docker desktop available RAMThis is the easiest fix. Just allocate more Memory to Docker Desktop by going to Preferences =&gt; Resources =&gt; Memory, and increase the value.While it fixes the immediate problem, the containers still consume a lot of memory, and if you have plenty of them, it might be a problem soon enough.In addition, changing the default configuration should be done by every user that wants to run the system with docker-compose, which introduces complexity in installation and usage.      ConclusionIf memory consumption is not an issue for you, just use ts-node in production and ts-node-dev in development.However, if you do care about memory, then you have a tradeoff between fast restart time after modifications (but typechecking only in the IDE, set --transpileOnly, or typechecking in compilation) and slower restart on each modification (directly use tsc and nodemon / node-dev ).",2021-03-03T17:38:44Z,#datascience #tutorials
DEV Community,https://dev.to,Closures in JavaScript,https://dev.to/bishnucit/closures-in-javascript-3cij,In JavaScript we can pack a function inside another function. When one function A is inside another function B then function A is called outer function while function A is called inner function and this phenomenon is called a closure.In closure the inner function can have access to the outer function scope.function B() {  let x = 7;  function A() {     console.log(x);  }  return A;}var c = B();c();&gt;7    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Closures are used to make private function or variables that has limited access. The outer function of a closure cannot access the inner function scope so it can be used to hide data.Apart from this use closure do have drawbacks where as long as closure is running memory cannot be garbage collected resulting to memory leaks. This can be avoided by making them null force fully after the use.,2021-03-03T16:28:43Z,#datascience #tutorials
