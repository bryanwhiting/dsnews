Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#269 HoloViz - a suite of tools for Python visualization,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/269/holoviz-a-suite-of-tools-for-python-visualization,"The toolchain for modern data science can be intimidating. How do you choose between all the data visualization libraries out there? How about creating interactive web apps from those analyses? On this episode, we dive into a project that attempts to bring the whole story together: HoloViz.  HoloViz is a coordinated effort to make browser-based data visualization in Python easier to use, easier to learn, and more powerful. And we have Philipp Rudiger from HoloViz here to guide us through it.Links from the showPhilipp on Twitter: @PhilippJFRHoloViews on Twitter: @HoloViewsPanel on Twitter: @Panel_orgDatashader on Twitter: @datashaderExamples: examples.pyviz.orgHoloViz tutorial: holoviz.orgPanel website: panel.holoviz.orgHoloViews website: holoviews.orgGeoViews website: geoviews.orgProject Discourse: discourse.holoviz.orgPyData Berlin talk: youtube.comCensus example: examples.pyviz.org/...SponsorsBrilliantDatadogTalk Python Training",2020-06-19T07:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#286 Python and ML at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL),https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/286/python-and-ml-at-nasa-jet-propulsion-laboratory-jpl,"NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)'s primary function is the construction and operation of planetary robotic spacecraft, though it also conducts Earth-orbit and astronomy missions. It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field. And he answers the question of whether he thinks we'll have Python running on robots and rovers in space.Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chrismattmannChris at JPL: jpl.nasa.govNature: A vision for data science: nature.comOpen source at JPL: github.comApache Nutch: nutch.apache.org7 Minutes of Terror: The Challenges of Getting to Mars: youtube.comtqdm package: pypi.orgPanama Papers: wikipedia.orgSponsorsLinodeMonday.comTalk Python Training",2020-10-16T07:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
