Meroxa is a new platform that aims to automate the heavy lifting of change data capture, monitoring, and data loading. In this episode founders DeVaris Brown and Ali Hamidi explain how their tenure at Heroku informed their approach to making data integration self service, how the platform is architected, and how they have designed their system to adapt to the continued evolution of the data ecosystem.",2020-10-05T23:33:06Z,podcasts
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebastián Ramírez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,podcasts

If you are putting your workflows into production, then you need to consider how you are going to implement data security, including access controls and auditing. Different databases and storage systems all have their own method of restricting access, and they are not all compatible with each other. In order to simplify the process of securing your data in the Cloud Manav Mital created Cyral to provide a way of enforcing security as code. In this episode he explains how the system is architected, how it can help you enforce compliance, and what is involved in getting it integrated with your existing systems. This was a good conversation about an aspect of data management that is too often left as an afterthought.",2020-10-26T22:45:48Z,podcasts
