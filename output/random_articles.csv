Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#295 GIS + Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/295/gis-python,"Geography is the study of places and the relationships between people and their environments. Often we think of maps, but maps are static. GIS gets interesting when you realize that we're studying and visualizing data flowing through these locations and communities. In this episode, you'll meet Silas Toms. He's an author of several Python GIS books and the host of The Mappist Hour podcast. Are you ready to dive into GIS with Python?Links from the showSilas on twitter Twitter: @loki_presidentSilas' Books:Mastering Geospatial Analysis with Python: Explore GIS processing and learn to work with GeoDjango, CARTOframes and MapboxGL-Jupyter: amazon.comArcPy and ArcGIS – Geospatial Analysis with Python: amazon.comArcPy and ArcGIS - Second Edition: Automating ArcGIS for Desktop and ArcGIS Online with Python: amazon.comThe Mappyist Hour podcast: themappyisthour.comPackagesGeoAlchemy ORM: geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.ioLeaflet.js: leafletjs.comMapbox GL: mapbox.comDeck GL: deck.glSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-12-18T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Streaming Data Integration Without The Code at Equalum - Episode 161,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/equalum-streaming-data-integration-episode-161/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The first stage of every good pipeline is to perform data integration. With the increasing pace of change and the need for up to date analytics the need to integrate that data in near real time is growing. With the improvements and increased variety of options for streaming data engines and improved tools for change data capture it is possible for data teams to make that goal a reality. However, despite all of the tools and managed distributions of those streaming engines it is still a challenge to build a robust and reliable pipeline for streaming data integration, especially if you need to expose those capabilities to non-engineers. In this episode Ido Friedman, CTO of Equalum, explains how they have built a no-code platform to make integration of streaming data and change data capture feeds easier to manage. He discusses the challenges that are inherent in the current state of CDC technologies, how they have architected their system to integrate well with existing data platforms, and how to build an appropriate level of abstraction for such a complex problem domain. If you are struggling with streaming data integration and change data capture then this interview is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-30T23:36:49Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebastián Ramírez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Need alerts for changes on a website, for example enrollment is now open at your college and you want to be first to get in and avoid the 8am Monday morning course slot? There's an API for that.
