Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,How Shopify Is Building Their Production Data Warehouse Using DBT - Episode 171,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/shopify-data-warehouse-with-dbt-episode-171/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"With all of the tools and services available for building a data platform it can be difficult to separate the signal from the noise. One of the best ways to get a true understanding of how a technology works in practice is to hear from people who are running it in production. In this episode Zeeshan Qureshi and Michelle Ark share their experiences using DBT to manage the data warehouse for Shopify. They explain how the structured the project to allow for multiple teams to collaborate in a scalable manner, the additional tooling that they added to address the edge cases that they have run into, and the optimizations that they baked into their continuous integration process to provide fast feedback and reduce costs. This is a great conversation about the lessons learned from real world use of a specific technology and how well it lives up to its promises.",2021-02-09T01:43:41Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
