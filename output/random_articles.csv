Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#289 Discovering exoplanets with Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/289/discovering-exoplanets-with-python,"When I saw the headline ""Machine learning algorithm confirms 50 new exoplanets in historic first"" I knew the Python angle of this story had to be told! And that's how this episode was born. Join David Armstrong and Jev Gamper as they tell us how they use Python and machine learning to discover not 1, but 50 new exoplanets in pre-existing Keplar satellite data.Links from the showJev Gamper on Twitter: @brutforcimagMachine learning algorithm confirms 50 new exoplanets in historic first article: techrepublic.comSponsorsBrilliantTalk Python Training",2020-11-09T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Streaming Data Integration Without The Code at Equalum - Episode 161,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/equalum-streaming-data-integration-episode-161/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"The first stage of every good pipeline is to perform data integration. With the increasing pace of change and the need for up to date analytics the need to integrate that data in near real time is growing. With the improvements and increased variety of options for streaming data engines and improved tools for change data capture it is possible for data teams to make that goal a reality. However, despite all of the tools and managed distributions of those streaming engines it is still a challenge to build a robust and reliable pipeline for streaming data integration, especially if you need to expose those capabilities to non-engineers. In this episode Ido Friedman, CTO of Equalum, explains how they have built a no-code platform to make integration of streaming data and change data capture feeds easier to manage. He discusses the challenges that are inherent in the current state of CDC technologies, how they have architected their system to integrate well with existing data platforms, and how to build an appropriate level of abstraction for such a complex problem domain. If you are struggling with streaming data integration and change data capture then this interview is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-30T23:36:49Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#278 Teach kids Python with real programming and fun games at Code Combat,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/278/teach-kids-python-with-real-programming-and-fun-games-at-code-combat,"If there is one message I've been pushing across all of the Talk Python episodes, it's that programming is a superpower. Rather than all of us abandoning what we're interested in and becoming CS majors, we can take our passion or expertise and 10x it with a little programming skill. In that case, we should be teaching kids fluency in programming at a younger age. And yet, almost every platform or example meant to do so pulls its punches. We'll teach kids programming concepts but not code itself. That's a bridge too far.But it's not! That's why I'm excited about Code Combat. It's an online coding platform that uses real Python syntax to guide your hero, visually, through a dungeon full of challenges. Yet the editor and customized error messages mean this is approachable for kids before they can even type reliably.On this episode, we'll meet Nick Winter, one of the cofounders of Code Combat. There's a lot of philosophy behind the tool and technology to make it kid-friend and real Python at the same time.Oh, and it's running Python in the browser.Links from the showCodeCombat: codecombat.comOn TwitterCode Combat: @CodeCombatNick Winter: @nwinterNick's website: nickwinter.netCode Combat on GitHub: github.com/codecombatBrett's learnable programming talk: worrydream.comOzaria: ozaria.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,How to retry an HTTP request in Angular (with plenty of code examples),https://dev.to/dkreider/how-to-retry-an-http-request-in-angular-with-plenty-of-code-examples-32lh,"How do you gracefully deal with a failed HTTP request?      Here's the few lines of Angular code you can use to manage HTTP failures.Some Angular apps can be as clumsy as a soccer-playing elephant. When they fail they fall HARD.And others are as nimble as a head-bonking rock star. Interested in knowing how you can make your Angular web app more nimble and tough by gracefully handing HTTP failures? Read on.      It starts with an HTTP interceptorOpen a terminal in your Angular project and whip it up with the Angular CLI like so.ng generate interceptor monitor    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    And then we'll import it into our module file by adding it to the providers array.providers: [    {       provide: HTTP_INTERCEPTORS,       useClass: MonitorInterceptor,       multi: true    }]    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          Wield the interceptor to retry failed requestsNext we'll open the new monitor.interceptor.ts file. It should look something like this.import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';import {  HttpRequest,  HttpHandler,  HttpEvent,  HttpInterceptor} from '@angular/common/http';import { Observable } from 'rxjs';@Injectable()export class MonitorInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {  constructor() {}  intercept(request: HttpRequest&lt;unknown&gt;, next: HttpHandler): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;unknown&gt;&gt; {    return next.handle(request);  }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    As you probably already know this interceptor can be used to modify any incoming or outgoing HTTP requests.How do we get the benefits of an Angular interceptor? The answer is simple.To add the retry capability we'll use the retry function that triggers a retry when the Observable fails.Here's how you do it buster.import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';import {  HttpRequest,  HttpHandler,  HttpEvent,  HttpInterceptor} from '@angular/common/http';import { Observable } from 'rxjs';import { retry } from 'rxjs/operators';export const retryCount = 3;@Injectable()export class MonitorInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {  constructor() {}  intercept(request: HttpRequest&lt;unknown&gt;, next: HttpHandler): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;unknown&gt;&gt; {    return next.handle(request).pipe(      retry(retryCount)    )  }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    Now if any HTTP request fails it will retry that request another 3 times.       How do you retry on certain response status codes?import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';import {  HttpRequest,  HttpHandler,  HttpEvent,  HttpInterceptor} from '@angular/common/http';import { Observable, of, throwError } from 'rxjs';import { concatMap, delay, retryWhen } from 'rxjs/operators';export const retryCount = 3;export const retryWaitMilliSeconds = 1000;@Injectable()export class MonitorInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {  constructor() {}  intercept(request: HttpRequest&lt;unknown&gt;, next: HttpHandler): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;unknown&gt;&gt; {    return next.handle(request).pipe(      retryWhen(error =&gt;         error.pipe(          concatMap((error, count) =&gt; {            if (count &lt;= retryCount &amp;&amp; error.status == 503) {              return of(error);            }            return throwError(error);          }),          delay(retryWaitMilliSeconds)        )      )    )  }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          How do you resend request after a reauthentication proceedure like a token refresh?How do a handle a scenario when the server responds with a 401? And you need to do some sort of login or token refresh?Here's the code.import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';import {  HttpRequest,  HttpHandler,  HttpEvent,  HttpInterceptor} from '@angular/common/http';import { Observable, throwError } from 'rxjs';import { catchError, switchMap } from 'rxjs/operators';export const retryCount = 3;@Injectable()export class MonitorInterceptor implements HttpInterceptor {  constructor() {}  intercept(request: HttpRequest&lt;unknown&gt;, next: HttpHandler): Observable&lt;HttpEvent&lt;unknown&gt;&gt; {    return next.handle(request).pipe(catchError(error =&gt; {        if (error.status === 401) {          return this.reAuthenticate().pipe(            switchMap(() =&gt; next.handle(request))          )        }        return throwError(error);      })    )  }  reAuthenticate(): Observable&lt;any&gt; {    // Do your auth call here  }}    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    You can find a more elaborate example here.      ConclusionIn this guide we've looked at different ways to gracefully handle a failed HTTP request.Failing gracefully might seem like a small detail that's not worth batting an eye-lid at but when done properly your users will be appreciative.Questions or comments?
