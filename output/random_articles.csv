Again, expect examples with no math and minimal crappy names      puts and gets MethodsThe puts method in Ruby is similar to the print() function in Python. puts sends output to the $stdout variable which is then shown in the console. We can do the opposite and get a value from input in the console that will be stored in $stdin until you use the gets method.#rubyputs 'What should we call you?'name = gets.stripputs ""Welcome, #{name}! üëã  Nice to meet you.""puts ""So #{name}, I see you're not familiar with Ruby.""puts ""What makes you think we should hire you?""why_qualified = gets.stripputs ""Okay, I see you #{why_qualified}.""puts ""I've also heard you spent the last week picking up Ruby. How's that going?""feels_about_ruby = gets.stripputs ""It sounds like you could pick Ruby up rather quickly""puts ""I imagine you'd do well working with our senior TSE""puts ""Anything else?""confident_ending = gets.stripputs ""#{confident_ending}, too.

A String v Raw String ErrorWhen running the code above, I got an error that confused me for a moment. I noticed I had used '' instead of """". This would be fine in Python, but '' in Ruby make it a raw string. So, it wasn't pulling in the user input name.      Even or OddIs it even or odd? This algorithm is a commonly asked one that isn't as easy as it could be in Python. Yet again, Ruby has a simple answer for this.# rubynumber = 2753number.even?    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    # pythonnumber = 2753if number % 2 == 0:    print(""is even"")  # remainder == 0else:    print(""is odd"")  # remainder not 0    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode          What am I using to learn?In order, so far, I have used the below siteshttps://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/to-ruby-from-python/https://try.ruby-lang.org/http://ruby-for-beginners.rubymonstas.org/https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.2/Reminder to self: do not work at places that think unpaid work is acceptable.
