Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#283 Web scraping, the 2020 edition",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/283/web-scraping-the-2020-edition,"Web scraping is pulling the HTML of a website down and parsing useful data out of it. The use-cases for this type of functionality are endless. Have a bunch of data on governmental sites that are only listed online in HTML without a download? There's an API for that! Do you want to keep abreast of what your competitors are featuring on their site? There's an API for that. Need alerts for changes on a website, for example enrollment is now open at your college and you want to be first to get in and avoid the 8am Monday morning course slot? There's an API for that. That API is screen scraping and Attila Tóth from ScrapingHub is here to tell us all about it.Links from the showAttila Tóth on LinkedIn: linkedin.comScrapy project: scrapy.orgScrapinghub on Twitter: @scrapinghubScrapinghub: scrapinghub.comcookiecutter template for Scrapy projects: github.comSplash: headless browser designed specifically for web scraping: scrapinghub.com/splashAwesome Web Scraping list: github.comTalk Python episode 50 on web scraping: talkpython.fmHow Web Scraping is Revealing Lobbying and Corruption in Peru: blog.scrapinghub.comWeb Data Extraction Summit event: extractsummit.ioSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-09-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Data Engineering Podcast,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com,Keeping A Bigeye On The Data Quality Market - Episode 160,https://www.dataengineeringpodcast.com/bigeye-data-quality-market-episode-160/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss,"One of the oldest aphorisms about data is ""garbage in, garbage out"", which is why the current boom in data quality solutions is no surprise. With the growth in projects, platforms, and services that aim to help you establish and maintain control of the health and reliability of your data pipelines it can be overwhelming to stay up to date with how they all compare. In this episode Egor Gryaznov, CTO of Bigeye, joins the show to explore the landscape of data quality companies, the general strategies that they are using, and what problems they solve. He also shares how his own product is designed and the challenges that are involved in building a system to help data engineers manage the complexity of a data platform. If you are wondering how to get better control of your own pipelines and the traps to avoid then this episode is definitely worth a listen.",2020-11-23T23:26:25Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
