Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#279 Modern Python Developer's Toolkit,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/279/modern-python-developers-toolkit,"Python is quick and easy to learn. And yet, there is a massive gap between knowing the common aspects of the language (loops, variables, functions, and so on) and how to write a well-factored application using modern tools and libraries. That's where learning Python is a never-ending journey. Sebastian Witowski is here to give us his take on a modern Python developer's toolkit. There are a bunch of great tips in store for us.Links from the showSebastian on Twitter: @SebaWitowskiThe tutorial recording from PyCon: youtube.comSebastian’s website: switowski.comWorkshop resources site: pycon.switowski.comWriting Faster Python talk: youtube.comHugo Static Site Theme: gohugo.ioAnnouncements at Talk PythonPython Memory Course: talkpython.fm/memExcel to Python and Pandas Course: talkpython.fm/excelExcel to Python Webcast: talkpython.fm/excel-webcastTeam Cohorts: talkpython.fm/cohortsSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-29T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

If you are putting your workflows into production, then you need to consider how you are going to implement data security, including access controls and auditing. Different databases and storage systems all have their own method of restricting access, and they are not all compatible with each other. In order to simplify the process of securing your data in the Cloud Manav Mital created Cyral to provide a way of enforcing security as code. In this episode he explains how the system is architected, how it can help you enforce compliance, and what is involved in getting it integrated with your existing systems. This was a good conversation about an aspect of data management that is too often left as an afterthought.",2020-10-26T22:45:48Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#293 Learning how to learn as a developer,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/293/learning-how-to-learn-as-a-developer,"As software developers, we live in a world of uncertainty and flux. Do you need to build a new web app? Well maybe using Django makes the most sense if you've been doing it for a long time. There is Flask, but it's more mix and match being a microframework. But you've also heard that async and await are game changers and FastAPI might be the right choice. Whatever it is you're building, there is constant pressure to stay on top of a moving target. Learning is not something you do in school then get a job as a developer. No, it a constant and critical part of your career. That's why we all need to be good, very good, at it.Matt Harrison is back on Talk Python to talk to us about some tips, tricks, and even science about learning as software developers.Links from the showMatt on Twitter: @__mharrison__Matt's Learning Course (use code TALKPYTHON20 for 20% off): mattharrison.podia.comFriends of the show: talkpython.fm/friends-of-the-showStreamlit: streamlit.ioJupyter LSP: github.com/krassowski/jupyterlab-lspSponsorsBrilliantLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-12-01T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,You Can Run Containers on AWS Amplify Now,https://dev.to/swyx/you-can-run-containers-on-aws-amplify-now-23ka,"The second week of AWS re:Invent brought a surprise major announcement from the AWS Amplify team: You can run Docker containers as AWS Amplify APIs now!!!The main Achilles heel of migrating to serverless architectures is having to relearn and rewrite traditional serverful code. With the new Amplify Serverless Containers, it is now possible to deploy code in stateful Docker containers with the exact same workflow as the rest of Amplify CLI.# example of the new CLI workflow, see docs for details# Amplify CLI version 4.39+$ amplify init # if you're setting up new Amplify project$ amplify configure project &gt; Do you want to enable container-based deployments? Yes$ amplify add apiPlease select from one of the below mentioned services: REST? Which service would you like to use   API Gateway + Lambda ❯ API Gateway + AWS Fargate (Container-based)     Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    For the first time, this opens up the possibility of running Rails, Django, Laravel, or any other traditionally serverful APIs seamlessly alongside a serverless architecture. If it fits in a Docker container, you can run it! This thus unlocks the full capabilities of their respective ecosystems. Emphasis on seamless integration: this means that frontend and mobile developers don't need to go to 9 months of cloud school (having to learn the details of VPC, subnets, NACLs, IAM policies, SSL generation, continuous deploy, cost optimization, etc) just in order to get a containerized API up and running on AWS.This, to me, is a big deal for a number of interrelated reasons:Long Running Code: AWS Lambda functions are limited to 15 minutes. If I need to run longer tasks, like video conversion or batch processing, I would have to jump out of my existing workflow and use a completely different set of tools. Now, I can run Rails + Sidekiq or Flask + Celery with just an industry standard docker-compose.yml. Because Amplify's Serverless Containers feature uses AWS Fargate, we may in future have the option of vertically scaling system resources as needed, beyond the traditional resource constraints of AWS Lambda.Access Entire Ecosystems: Libraries and frameworks that were written for serverful paradigms typically become useless when shifting to serverless/Jamstack architectures, requiring yet another learning curve and search for tools. Now you are free to mix and match them - anything that runs in a Docker container is fair game (and everything runs in a Docker container!)Incremental Migration: This also means that it is no longer a heavy lift to move existing apps and codebases to a serverless/Jamstack architecture. As long as you can separate your UI layer from your API layer, you are now able to host your UI on Amplify Console, and your APIs as a REST or GraphQL service with API Gateway + AWS Fargate.Easy Access to other Amplify categories: because this plugs right into the Amplify API category workflow, this means that your code inside your containers get all the same benefits of Amplify APIs like easy authentication with Amazon Cognito and easy access to Amplify-managed resources like Storage, Functions, GraphQL and more. Because networking is handled for you, you can even talk to other containers - the default docker-compose.yml example in the CLI shows how you can make an Express (JS) app interoperate with a Flask (Python) app!So, yeah. I think this is awesome - You can run basically anything on AWS Amplify now - meaning that you spend less time wrangling infrastructure and more time writing valuable features. Don't take my word for it, see Ant Stanley (organizer of Serverless Days and overall cloud expert):                          Ant Stanley Partial Landscaping #BLM                    @iamstan                                        This is awesome. Easiest way to run a stateful workload in the cloud. Got Wordpress, Django, Express, Joomla, Flask, Laravel etc ... this is the easiest and quickest way to get it running in a scalable way in the cloud. twitter.com/renebrandel/st…              17:36 PM - 10 Dec 2020                                        Rene Brandel                    @renebrandel                ⭐️NEW: @AWSAmplify now supports containers⭐️👉 Deploy APIs &amp; host web apps using @awscloud Fargate👉 Build &amp; deploy pipeline out-of-the-box👉 Single &amp; multi-container deployments (incl. networking)Amazing work by @panchorodriguez @menyao @undef_obj https://t.co/YBhqVkqnCS                                                        2                          10      P.S. for those who are making comparisons with AWS CDK, note that this capability was actually made with CDK - it solves a higher level problem than CDK.",2020-12-11T14:24:37Z,#datascience #tutorials
