Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#309 What ML Can Teach Us About Life: 7 Lessons,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/309/what-ml-can-teach-us-about-life-7-lessons,"Machine learning and data science are full of best practices and important workflows. Can we extrapolate these to our broader lives? Eugene Yan and I give it a shot on this slightly more philosophical episode of Talk Python To Me. The seven lessons:1. Data cleaning: Assess what you consume2. Low vs. high signal data: Seek to disconfirm and update3. Explore-Exploit: Balance for greater long-term reward4. Transfer Learning: Books and papers are cheat codes5. Iterations: Find reps you can tolerate, and iterate fast6. Overfitting: Focus on intuition and keep learning7.

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#304 asyncio all the things with Omnilib,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/304/asyncio-all-the-things-with-omnilib,"The relatively recent introduction of async and await as keywords in Python have spawned a whole area of high performance, highly scalable frameworks and supporting libraries. One such library that has great async building blocks is Omnilib. On this episode, you'll meet John Reese. John is the creator of Omnilib, which includes packages such as aioitertools, aiomultiprocess, and aiosqlite.

You can visualize the APIs with the smooth scalability taking to the mobile apps. You can see how, finally, this time, you'll get deployment right and it'll be pure continuous delivery out of GitHub with zero downtime. What you're probably not dreaming about is writing yet another password reset form and integrating mail capabilities just for this purpose. Or how you'll securely store user accounts the right way this time.Don't worry, we got you covered. Our guests, Christos Matskas and John Patrick Dandison are here to cover a bunch of different libraries and techniques we can use for adding identity to our Python applications.Links from the showChristos on Twitter: @christosmatskasJohn Patrick Dandison on Twitter: @azureandchillshhgit live: shhgit.comTwitch channel for Christos and JP: twitch.tv/425showPasslib & Folding: passlib.readthedocs.ioMicrosoft Authentication Library: github.com/AzureADauthlib - JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption draft implementation: github.comdjango-allauth - Authentication app for Django that ""just works"": github.comdjango-oauth-toolkit - OAuth 2 goodies for Django: github.compython-oauth2 - A fully tested, abstract interface to creating OAuth clients and servers: github.compython-social-auth - An easy-to-setup social authentication mechanism: github.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-26T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
