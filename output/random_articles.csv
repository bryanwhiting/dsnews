Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#274 Profiling data science code with FIL,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/274/profiling-data-science-code-with-fil,"Do you write data science code? Do you struggle loading large amounts of data or wonder what parts of your code use the maximum amount of memory? Maybe you just want to require smaller compute resources (servers, RAM, and so on).   If so, this episode is for you. We have Itamar Turner-Trauring, creator of the Python data science memory profiler FIL here to talk memory usage and data science.Links from the showItamar on twitter: @itamarstFIL: pythonspeed.comPython Bytes coverage of FIL: pythonbytes.fmVideo: Small Big Data: using NumPy and Pandas when your data doesn't fit in memory: youtube.comSoftware Engineering for Data Scientists Article: pythonspeed.comPython Tutor: pythontutor.comWeak references: docs.python.orgmemory_profiler package: github.comAustin profiler: github.comWSL2 on Windows: pbpython.com/wsl-python.htmlSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-24T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#284 Modern and fast APIs with FastAPI,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/284/modern-and-fast-apis-with-fastapi,"As Python 3 has eclipsed the old constrains of Python 2 and web frameworks that adopted them, we have seen a big jump in new frameworks appearing on the scene taking full advantage of things like type hints, async and await, and more.  No framework has done this more successfully than FastAPI recently. That's why we are here with the creator of FastAPI, Sebastián Ramírez to dive into this exciting new Python web framework.Links from the showSebastian: @tiangoloFastAPI: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI: One of the fastest Python frameworks available: fastapi.tiangolo.comFastAPI for Flask Users: amitness.comFastAPI Docker image:  https://github.com/tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-fastapi-dockerujson: github.comuvicorn: uvicorn.orgTraffic server: docs.traefik.ioStarlette: starlette.ioPydantic: pydantic-docs.helpmanual.ioSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-04T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#288 10 tips to move from Excel to Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/288/10-tips-to-move-from-excel-to-python,"Excel is one of the most used and most empowering piece of software out there. But that doesn't make it a good fit for every data processing need. And when you outgrow Excel, a really good option for a next step is Python and the data science tech stack: Pandas, Jupyter, and friends. Chris Moffitt is back on Talk Python to give us concrete tips and tricks for moving from Excel to Python!Links from the showChris on Twitter: @chris1610Practical Business Python: pbpython.comEscaping Excel Hell with Python and Pandas Episode 200: talkpython.fmSideTable package: pbpython.comLearn more and go deeperMove from Excel to Python with Pandas Course: training.talkpython.fmExcel to Python webcast: crowdcast.ioSponsorsVoyager gameLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-10-31T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#278 Teach kids Python with real programming and fun games at Code Combat,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/278/teach-kids-python-with-real-programming-and-fun-games-at-code-combat,"If there is one message I've been pushing across all of the Talk Python episodes, it's that programming is a superpower. Rather than all of us abandoning what we're interested in and becoming CS majors, we can take our passion or expertise and 10x it with a little programming skill. In that case, we should be teaching kids fluency in programming at a younger age. And yet, almost every platform or example meant to do so pulls its punches. We'll teach kids programming concepts but not code itself. That's a bridge too far.But it's not! That's why I'm excited about Code Combat. It's an online coding platform that uses real Python syntax to guide your hero, visually, through a dungeon full of challenges. Yet the editor and customized error messages mean this is approachable for kids before they can even type reliably.On this episode, we'll meet Nick Winter, one of the cofounders of Code Combat. There's a lot of philosophy behind the tool and technology to make it kid-friend and real Python at the same time.Oh, and it's running Python in the browser.Links from the showCodeCombat: codecombat.comOn TwitterCode Combat: @CodeCombatNick Winter: @nwinterNick's website: nickwinter.netCode Combat on GitHub: github.com/codecombatBrett's learnable programming talk: worrydream.comOzaria: ozaria.comSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-08-21T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
