Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

In order to handle the volume and variety of information that they use to run and improve the business the data team has to build a platform that analysts and data scientists can use in a self-service manner. In this episode the head of data platform for DoorDash, Sudhir Tonse, discusses the technologies that they are using, the approach that they take to adding new systems, and how they think about priorities for what to support for the whole company vs what to leave as a specialized concern for a single team. This is a valuable look at how to manage a large and growing data platform with that supports a variety of teams with varied and evolving needs.",2021-03-16T01:23:57Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,How to optimize your blade views in Laravel,https://dev.to/arielmejiadev/how-to-optimize-your-blade-views-in-laravel-173l,"The ContextI want to update my personal site in 2019 &amp; 2020 I was using NuxtJS, this year I got the idea to change it to a Laravel application with blade views, tailwind &amp; just a sprinkle of javascript using alpineJS.      The challengeI want a beautiful landing page with a great performance, hopefully all lighthouse stats on green.      The tipsI would going to share how I get all lighthouse on green an a few little more tricks.Purge your css using tailwindcss.Many browsers actually support the loading=""lazy"" attribute so use it on your images that are not loaded on the visual ratio  when your site loads.Minify your Javascript in my case I only have one file, but if you have more files laravel mix can attach them and minify them on production.load Javascript only when is required, I only use alpineJS on contact form page so adding js scripts conditionally could help to load faster your site, here an example:@if(Route::is('contact'))    &lt;script src=""public/js/app.js""&gt;&lt;/script&gt;@endifprotect your links with target blank using rel=""noopener noreferrer"" attribute, it prevents an attack called tabnapping.optimize the images by reducing the size and weight of images, you can use something like: https://tinypng.comtake care about accesibility, there are some text color that simply does not contrast enough take that in mind, lighthouse offers some tips on that cases just follow them.use SSL certificate on your site, lighthouse take that in mind and your users a site without SSL cert looks like an unsafe site.use SVGs when you can, they are optimized for the web, or even better when you can use web.p format.Take care about responsiveness of your site, it would not be a stat but definitely more people would visit your site first on mobile than desktop, so take that in mind.Add an alternative text to every image, even if its just an asset:&lt;img src=""me.png"" alt=""picture of me"" /&gt;// on svgs you can use the title tag&lt;svg fill=""currentColor"" stroke-linecap=""round"" stroke-linejoin=""round"" stroke-width=""2"" class=""w-5 h-5"" viewBox=""0 0 24 24"" aria-labelledby=""twitter_logo""&gt;    &lt;title id=""twitter_logo""&gt;Twitter logo&lt;/title&gt;    &lt;path d=""M23 3a10.9 10.9 0 01-3.14 1.53 4.48 4.48 0 00-7.86 3v1A10.66 10.66 0 013 4s-4 9 5 13a11.64 11.64 0 01-7 2c9 5 20 0 20-11.5a4.5 4.5 0 00-.08-.83A7.72 7.72 0 0023 3z""&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;Optimize your Laravel application when you are going to make a deploy:Locally:npm run prodOn Server:clear and cache again the config files, routes &amp; views.// clear cachephp artisan config:clearphp artisan route:clearphp artisan view:clear// cache filesphp artisan config:cachephp artisan route:cachephp artisan view:cachephp artisan optimizeAdd SEO, with Laravel you can use SEOTOOLS package that is great and easy to use: https://github.com/artesaos/seotoolsAdd a sitemap.xml file to instruct the google crawler about your site pages, with again with Laravel it is easy using a SPATIE package: https://github.com/spatie/laravel-sitemap.If your site would add a newsletter you can use this useful package, from... you guess SPATIE: https://github.com/spatie/laravel-newsletterAdd cache on your server, if you are going to use NGINX you can set easily some configuration to cache assets like images or pdf files from one request to other by an amount of time that you can customize, here the configuration that I use on my site to compress config &amp; cache assets:# gzip compression settingsgzip on;gzip_comp_level 5;gzip_min_length 256;gzip_proxied any;gzip_vary on;# browser cache static assets controllocation ~* \.(ico|css|js|gif|jpeg|jpg|png|woff|ttf|otf|svg|woff2|eot)$ {     expires 1d;     access_log off;     add_header Pragma public;     add_header Cache-Control ""public, max-age=86400"";}# browser caching of pdfslocation ~*  \.(pdf)$ {    expires 365d;}You can handle all files in just one location block, but in my case as the PDF file in my site would not change as much, I separate it into another location block.Hope this tips would be useful on your Laravel blade public views, as always thanks for reading, happy coding &amp; let me know in the comments if you found it useful.",2021-03-23T04:09:50Z,#datascience #tutorials
