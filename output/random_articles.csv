Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#296 Python in F1 racing,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/296/python-in-f1-racing,"Quick: Name the 3 most advanced engineering organizations you can think of? Maybe an aerospace company such as SpaceX or Boeing come to mind. Maybe you thought of CERN and the LHC. But in terms of bespoke engineering capabilities, you should certainly put the F1 racing teams on your list. These organizations appear as 20-30 people on a race day shown on TV. But in fact, the number of people back at the home base doing the engineering work can be over 500 employees. Almost every tiny part you see on these cars as well as the tools to maintain them are custom-built.The engineering problems solved are immense. Would it surprise you to know that Python is playing a major role here? On this episode, you'll meet Joe Borg who help pioneer Python's adoption at several F1 teams.Links from the showJoe's website: josephb.orgJoe on Twitter: @joedborgRacing Point F1 team: racingpointf1.comScuderia Alpha Tauri F1 team: scuderiaalphatauri.comMicroK8s: microk8s.ioCharmed Kubernetes: ubuntu.com/kubernetesSponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-12-23T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

There are a number of managed platforms available, but the list of options for an open source system that supports a large variety of sources and destinations is still embarrasingly short. The team at Airbyte is adding a new entry to that list with the goal of making robust and easy to use data integration more accessible to teams who want or need to maintain full control of their data. In this episode co-founders John Lafleur and Michel Tricot share the story of how and why they created Airbyte, discuss the project's design and architecture, and explain their vision of what an open soure data integration platform should offer. If you are struggling to maintain your extract and load pipelines or spending time on integrating with a new system when you would prefer to be working on other projects then this is definitely a conversation worth listening to.",2021-02-23T02:04:59Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

DEV Community,https://dev.to,"Creating a fun, fast, secure and sustainable website",https://dev.to/madsstoumann/creating-a-fun-fast-secure-and-sustainable-website-50nk,"In the last couple of months, I've been writing (some would say preaching!) about security, performance, accessibilty and other aspects of frontend development. Then I discovered, that my own website hadn't been updated in almost 10 years, and didn't really live up to my current standards! In this post, I'll show you how I re-wrote my site, and achieved the perfect Lighthouse score: Before I started out, I set some goals for the site:      PlayfulI wanted the site to be engaging and playful. The content is very simple, so I wanted to present it in an alternate way. I ended up with a circular navigation:On mobile, I show a part of the circle:The playfulness is achieved with two tools.The first is a color tool (toggle it by clicking on the colorful square-icon top right) with hue-, saturation- and lightness-sliders - and an option to download the CSS for the theme, you create:The other tool is a polygon-tool (toggle it by clicking the hexagon-icon top left).This tool has two sliders: one for adding sides to the polygons, and one for midpoints:Combining the two tools, you can create crazy results like this:In the bottom left corner, there's a color-palette-icon, that'll enable a high-contrast black-and-white mode:And finally, in the bottom right corner, there's a button where you can toggle on/off transitions and animations. Why? I've written about it here.      ValidMany sites these days don't have valid markup. This is bad. Most browsers will try to ""figure out"" what's going on, and ""auto-correct"" markup mistakes. This requires extra ""calculations"" for the browser, and it might prevent a crawler from indexing the page correctly. I use Validity for testing the validity of my markup.      AccessibleI haven't tested the site with a real screen-reader, only with the one you get with Windows. Additionally, I've taken multiple actions in order to make it more accessible:      Document OutlineI use HTML5 Outliner to test the outline of a page:      Keyboard-friendlyYou can navigate the site without a pointer-device. I use focus-visible and custom styles for outlines (even on the circular navigation), when you're using a keyboard. You ""open"" an article with Enter, close it with Escape - and I've included focus-trapping, so you can cycle the links within an article.The tools use &lt;input type=""range""&gt;, which can be updated with the arrow keys.      Disable animationsAs mentioned earlier, you can disable animations and transitions.      Visual deficienciesIn the Rendering-tab of Chrome Dev Tools, you can emulate visual deficiencies.Test all of them, one by one, to see if any of them is unreadable.Here's deuteranopia:The reason why I've included the hue-slider as part of the main design, is for people with visual deficiencies. Hopefully, no matter which visual deficiency a user has, s/he can choose a color-palette of their own choice.The main navigation is readable with blurred vision:Zooming-in, the text should be readable as well:      FastThe combined size of the minified HTML, CSS and JavaScript of the entire website is approx. 11kb. I've not used a build-tool, it's all hardcoded.Most logic is in CSS Custom Properties. All the colors in the color tool, for instance, are auto-generated colors using calc() in CSS, based on values from the hue-, saturation- and lightness-sliders.I use the Montserrat-typeface, but host the font-files on my own server, avoiding a round-trip to Google Fonts. The font is preloaded:&lt;link rel=""preload"" href=""assets/fonts/montserrat-v15-latin-regular.woff2"" crossorigin=""anonymous"" as=""font"" type=""font/woff2""&gt;      SecureI use a Content-Security-Policy:&lt;meta http-equiv=""Content-Security-Policy"" content=""  default-src;  script-src 'self';  style-src 'self';  img-src 'self' data:;  font-src 'self';  connect-src 'self';  media-src 'self';  object-src 'none';  frame-src;  form-action;  base-uri;  manifest-src 'self';""&gt;... and I've set up Security Headers:Mozilla Observatory:      SustainableBecause I use a green CDN (Cloudflare) - and because of the low page-weight, it's very easy to achieve a good sustainability-score:In web-development, sustainability equals performance, so PageSpeed is happy as well:  I've used my favourite nuances of blue on the site, although blue pixels use more electricity than red or green pixels.       PWA and offlineI've added a site.manifest and a ServiceWorker with caching, so the site works offline. Google are improving Progressive Web App offline support detection, so I'll have to make some updates before August 2021!      Final thoughtsHope you liked this walkthrough of my new site. Remember, nothing lasts forever in the world of web! The perfect scores will most likely change soon, as the web and what we expect of it, change as well.Go check it out: stoumann.dkThanks for reading!",2021-03-13T16:05:08Z,#datascience #tutorials
DEV Community,https://dev.to,"7 types of modern databases: purpose, advantages and disadvantages",https://dev.to/ra1nbow1/7-types-of-modern-databases-purpose-advantages-and-disadvantages-hmg,"There are hundreds of SQL and NoSQL databases. Some are popular, others are ignored. Some are simple and well documented, and some are difficult to use. Some are open source, while others are proprietary. Perhaps most importantly, some are scalable, optimized, highly available, and some are difficult to scale or maintain.A natural question arises: which database to choose from? To answer it, we need to decide what we want to achieve with the database. To form an idea, you need to answer the following questions::Do we need analytical access to the database?Do we need to write or read in real-time?How many tables/records do we want to keep?What kind of accessibility do we need?Do we need columns?Will we be able to access tables filtered by columns or by rows?When making a decision, you need to remember what a particular database can offer. The specifics of each database may differ, but in general, there are only a few types within which we can achieve basically the same goals. Let's look at them in more detail.      Relational SQL databasesIf you've ever worked with databases, most likely you started with this type, because it's the most popular and common. Such databases allow you to store data in relational tables with certain columns of a certain type. Relational tables are good for normalization and merging.Advantages:SQL supportACID transactions (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability)Indexing and partitioning supportDisadvantages:Poor support for unstructured data / complex typesPoor event handling optimizationComplex / expensive scalingExamples: Oracle DB, MySQL, PostgreSQL.      Document-oriented databasesIf we don't want to combine multiple tables to get the data we need, we can look at document-oriented databases. They allow you to store records in JSON format. In this format, we can create a complex value for any key and immediately include the entire data structure in a single record.Advantages:The scheme is free of chargeThere is no need to always write all the fields in each recordGood support for complex typesSuitable for OLTPDisadvantages:Poor transaction supportWeak analytical supportComplex / expensive scalingExamples: MongoDB.      In-memory databasesDatabases of this type can provide a real-time response for selecting and inserting specific records. Most of them mostly store data in RAM, but in some cases, they also offer persistent storage on hard drives or solid-state drives. Most of these databases work with key-value records, so the values can be stored in a document-oriented format. But some databases also work with columns and allow secondary indexing of the same table. Using RAM allows you to process data quickly, but makes it more unstable and expensive.Advantages:Quick WritingQuick ReadDisadvantages:High reliabilityExpensive scalingExamples: Redis, Tarantool, Apache Ignite.      Databases with wide columnsThese databases store data as key/value records on a hard disk or solid-state drive. These solutions are designed to scale well enough to manage petabytes of data on thousands of shared servers in a distributed system. They represent Stable architecture. This architecture was designed for two use cases: fast key access and fast write with high availability. Advantages:Quick entry line by lineQuick Key ReadingGood scalabilityHigh availabilityDisadvantages:Key-value format»No analytics supportExamples: Cassandra, HBase.      Columnar databasesSometimes we need to quickly access data not with specific keys, but with specific columns. In this case, it is better to abandon the line-by-line insertion and switch to the batch recording. Batch insertion allows columnar databases to prepare data for fast column-by-column reads. Advantages:Quick read column by columnGood analytical supportGood scalabilityDisadvantages:Only suitable for batch insertsExamples: Vertica, Clickhouse.      Search EngineIf we want to access the data by filtering by any value and even by any word in the column, we need to remember the search engines. These databases index each word in columns and allow a full-text search. They are ideal for storing and analyzing logs or large text values. Advantages:Quick access by any wordGood scalabilityDisadvantages:Only suitable for batch insertsPoor analytical supportExamples: Elastic.      Graph databasesFor some cases, graph data structures are suitable. If your tasks require working with graphs, there are special databases that will meet your needs. Advantages:Graph data structureManaged relationships between entitiesFlexible designsDisadvantages:Special query languageDifficult to scaleExamples: Neo4j.      ConclusionAlmost any task can be performed with almost any type of database. The question is how expensive and optimized it will be. Choosing a tool that you are used to can reduce your time to market. But it can also cost you a huge amount of money to maintain and expand your equipment, which can be used inefficiently. Always try to use the database as intended. Perhaps a solution that meets your needs already exists.",2021-03-13T17:55:32Z,#datascience #tutorials
