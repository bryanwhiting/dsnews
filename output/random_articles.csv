I've put together a great group to look back on 2020 - from the Python perspective. Join me along with Cecil Phillip, Ines Montani, Jay Miller, Paul Everitt, Reuven Lerner, Matt Harrison, and Brian Okken for a light-hearted and fun look back on the major Python events of 2020.Links from the showVideo version of this episode: youtube.comGuestsCecil Phillip: @cecilphillipInes Montani: @_inesmontaniJay Miller: @kjaymillerPaul Everitt: @paulweverittReuven Lerner: @reuvenmlernerMatt Harrison: @__mharrison__Brian Okken: @brianokkenSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-28T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#291 Operational Resilience with Pyomo,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/291/operational-resilience-with-pyomo,"Do you have a scientific system that needs optimization or solving? Our guest, on this episode, Clark Petri is here to tell us all about pyomo. This is a library that can solve all sorts of cool problems, linear programming, nonlinear equations, and many other things you can throw at it.  We're gonna solve a really fun diet problem: What is the most nutritious meal that you can eat for the least amount of money? The answer might surprise you a little bit! It's going to be a lot of fun. So listen in to hear about how Clark has used pyomo to do his work and how you might use it in yours.Links from the showPyomo: pyomo.orgClark on Twitter: @clarkpetriCenter for Infrastructure Defense: nps.eduThesis: apps.dtic.milI’m not alone in my work post: morenuance.comhandcalcs package: github.comDiet optimization problem: nbviewer.jupyter.orgTalk Python [Pro Edition]: talkpython.fm/proBlack Friday at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/blackfridaySponsorsTalk Python TrainingLinode",2020-11-22T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Maybe you're just looking for a way to work with those exciting libraries that aren't yet in play at the day job. Rather than putting everything on the line, quitting your job, and hoping things work out, maybe you should start with a side-hustle. On this episode, you'll meet Keith McCormick, a data scientist who has many irons in the fire and he's here to tell us about different types of side hustles and why you may want to try or avoid one.Links from the showKeith on Twitter: @kmccormickblogKeith on LinkedIn: linkedin.comKeith's courses: linkedin.comSide Hustle Strategies for Data Science and Analytics Experts course: linkedin.com/learningTalk Python's Excel to Python course: talkpython.fm/excelSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-11-13T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast
DEV Community,https://dev.to,Basic Hooks in React - useState(),https://dev.to/olenadrugalya/basic-hooks-in-react-usestate-4pag,"This blog post continues the series about React Hooks.Here we are exploring one of basic and most important hooks in React - useState().      What is useState()?useState() is JavaScript function, which is used in functional components to crate state and access it.  To use this hook, you need to import it first from React library like this:import {useState} from 'react';    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    You can use this hook without import as well like this - React.useState(), for me it's just more convenient to import and destructure first this function and then use it when need in the code.      How to useWe call this hook like this:const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This hook returns 2 values - stateful value and the function to update it.The first returned value is state -  this is the data we pass to hook as initialState parameter.The second returned value is setState - this is a function which is used to update the state.      Characteristics and tips you should knowreturned values from useState() can be called as you want. Its a good practice to call them with meaning, for example if you are building a Counter app, it's good to give state a meaningful name:const [count, setCount] = useState(0);    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    by calling useState() inside a function component, you create a single piece of state associated with that component.the state can be any type you want – you can useState() with an array, useState an object, a number, a boolean, a string, whatever you need. you can create multiples states in one component according to data which they hold:  const [items, setItems] = useState([]); // array  const [itemName, setItemName] = useState(""""); //string    Enter fullscreen mode        Exit fullscreen mode    This hook is especially useful for local component state, but larger projects might require additional state management solutions.Thank you for reading my blog.
