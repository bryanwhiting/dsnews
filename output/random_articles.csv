Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#294 oso authorizes Python,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/294/oso-authorizes-python,"When we think about accounts and security, we often think about identity (logging in and proving who you are). But for many applications, especially internal apps at large organizations, that's just step one. The next step is what can you do and what can you not do. In this episode, you'll learn about a new library called oso. It's a declarative way to create policy code that maps to your mental model for who is allowed to do what in your system. We have two guests, Graham Neray and Sam Scott from the oso project to tell us all about it.Links from the showOso on twitter: @osoHQGraham on twitter: @grahamneraySam on twitter: @samosososOso: osohq.comDjango docs: docs.osohq.comFlask docs: docs.osohq.comPython library docs: docs.osohq.comSource code: github.com/osohqDebugger docs: docs.osohq.comPolar Adventure: A text-based adventure game written in Polar: osohq.comAdding authorization to your Flask app with oso: osohq.comBuilding a Django app with data access controls: osohq.comDjango Queryset filters from oso policies: osohq.comRecent episode on authentication over at Talk Python: talkpython.fm/292MongoDB most wanted DB: insights.stackoverflow.comTalk Python [pro edition]: talkpython.fm/proFastAPI course: talkpython.fm/fastapiSponsorsTalk Python Training",2020-12-07T00:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

It is also responsible for operating NASA's Deep Space Network.  On this episode, you'll meet Chris Mattman. He's the Division Manager for the Artificial Intelligence, Analytics and Innovation at NASA JPL and he's JPL's first Principal Scientist in the area of Data Science. We cover a wide range of topics, and dive into how Python and open-source are growing in the space exploration field.

Blog – Machine Learning Mastery,https://machinelearningmastery.com,Gradient Descent With Nesterov Momentum From Scratch,https://machinelearningmastery.com/gradient-descent-with-nesterov-momentum-from-scratch/,Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that follows the negative gradient of an objective function in order to locate the minimum of the function. A limitation of gradient descent is that it can get stuck in flat areas or bounce around if the objective function returns noisy gradients.

I learned a lot and I had very cool colleagues. I started working as a game developer in Unity3D.After a year and 3 months I decided to change the corporation and started working for a bank in Italy, Milan. I worked in this bank for almost 1 year and a few months. The experience was very beautiful because I was working in a foreign country and I was starting to travel.After this experience I changed the corporation again and started working in the financial field. I work with Microsoft .net technologies on the backend and API integration side. The financial project was very complex. It was a web application from which I learned a lot. I had almost 5 years of experience in the field, but I didn't seem to be fully satisfied.Something was missing, but I didn't know what. I lacked freedom and independence.In 2021 I decided to try to find clients and become a freelancer.I started looking for projects on linkedin, upwork, everywhere.
