Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,#274 Profiling data science code with FIL,https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/274/profiling-data-science-code-with-fil,"Do you write data science code? Do you struggle loading large amounts of data or wonder what parts of your code use the maximum amount of memory? Maybe you just want to require smaller compute resources (servers, RAM, and so on).   If so, this episode is for you. We have Itamar Turner-Trauring, creator of the Python data science memory profiler FIL here to talk memory usage and data science.Links from the showItamar on twitter: @itamarstFIL: pythonspeed.comPython Bytes coverage of FIL: pythonbytes.fmVideo: Small Big Data: using NumPy and Pandas when your data doesn't fit in memory: youtube.comSoftware Engineering for Data Scientists Article: pythonspeed.comPython Tutor: pythontutor.comWeak references: docs.python.orgmemory_profiler package: github.comAustin profiler: github.comWSL2 on Windows: pbpython.com/wsl-python.htmlSponsorsLinodeTalk Python Training",2020-07-24T07:00:00Z,#datascience #ds #podcast

Talk Python To Me,https://talkpython.fm/,"#271 Unlock the mysteries of time, Python's datetime that is!",https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/271/unlock-the-mysteries-of-time-pythons-datetime-that-is,"Time is a simple thing, right? And working with it in Python is great. You just import datetime and then (somewhat oddly) use the datetime class from that module.  Oh except, there are times with timezones, and times without. And why is there a total_seconds() but not total_minutes(), hours() or days() on timedelta? How about computing the number of weeks? What if you wanted to iterate over the next 22 workdays, skipping weekends?Ok, we'd better talk about time in Python! Good thing Paul Ganssle is here.
